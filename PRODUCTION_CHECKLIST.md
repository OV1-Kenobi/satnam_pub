# Production Deployment Checklist - Encrypted Audit Logging

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Security Verification

### Environment Setup

- [ ] **PRIVACY_MASTER_KEY** environment variable is set with cryptographically secure 256-bit key
- [ ] Master key is NOT the default development key
- [ ] Master key is stored securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- [ ] Master key backup is stored separately from application deployment
- [ ] Key rotation procedure is documented and tested

### Security Testing

- [ ] Run `node test-audit-encryption.js` - all tests pass
- [ ] Verify encrypted audit details don't contain plaintext PII
- [ ] Test decryption with valid encrypted data
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid/corrupted encryption data
- [ ] Verify encryption failures don't expose sensitive data

### Database Schema

- [ ] `auth_audit_log.encrypted_details` column exists and accepts TEXT/JSON
- [ ] Database indices are optimized for audit log queries
- [ ] Database backup encryption includes audit log encryption metadata
- [ ] Database replication handles encrypted audit data correctly

### Application Testing

- [ ] All audit log creation functions use encryption
- [ ] No direct plaintext storage in audit details
- [ ] Decryption functions require proper authorization
- [ ] Error handling prevents data leakage on encryption failures
- [ ] Memory cleanup after encryption/decryption operations

## üîê Security Controls

### Access Control

- [ ] Audit detail decryption restricted to authorized personnel only
- [ ] All decryption attempts are logged and monitored
- [ ] Role-based access control for `getUserAuditLogWithDetails(decryptDetails=true)`
- [ ] API endpoints for audit access have proper authentication/authorization
- [ ] Rate limiting on audit access functions

### Monitoring & Alerting

- [ ] Monitor for encryption failures in application logs
- [ ] Alert on unusual audit detail decryption patterns
- [ ] Track master key access and rotation events
- [ ] Monitor database storage size changes
- [ ] Set up alerts for audit log tampering attempts

### Data Protection

- [ ] Encrypted audit data safe for database backups
- [ ] Replication doesn't expose plaintext PII
- [ ] Network transmission of audit data is secure
- [ ] Audit logs protected from unauthorized modification
- [ ] Retention policies account for encrypted data lifecycle

## üìã Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Set the production master key (NEVER use the default!)
export PRIVACY_MASTER_KEY="your-cryptographically-secure-256-bit-key"

# Verify the key is set correctly
node -e "console.log(process.env.PRIVACY_MASTER_KEY ? 'Key set ‚úÖ' : 'Key missing ‚ùå')"
```

### 2. Application Deployment

- [ ] Deploy updated `services/privacy-auth.ts` with encryption
- [ ] Deploy related type definitions and utilities
- [ ] Update any API endpoints that handle audit logs
- [ ] Deploy monitoring and alerting configurations

### 3. Database Migration

- [ ] Ensure `encrypted_details` column can handle the new encrypted format
- [ ] Test database performance with encrypted audit data
- [ ] Verify backup/restore procedures with encrypted data

### 4. Smoke Testing

```bash
# Run the encryption test in production environment
node test-audit-encryption.js

# Create a test audit log and verify encryption
curl -X POST /api/test-audit-encryption \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"test": "production_encryption_test"}'
```

### 5. Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Application performance monitoring for encryption overhead
- [ ] Security event monitoring for audit access
- [ ] Database monitoring for storage and performance
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured for encryption failures

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Encryption Failure Response

1. **Immediate**: Check application logs for encryption errors
2. **Investigate**: Verify master key availability and validity
3. **Fallback**: Audit logs created with error metadata instead of failing completely
4. **Resolution**: Fix encryption issues without losing audit trail

### Master Key Compromise

1. **Immediate**: Rotate master key using secure key rotation procedure
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope of potential data exposure
3. **Notification**: Follow incident response plan for data security events
4. **Recovery**: Re-encrypt existing audit data with new master key if required

### Data Recovery

- [ ] Master key backup procedure tested and documented
- [ ] Database restore with encrypted audit data verified
- [ ] Recovery time objectives (RTO) defined for audit system
- [ ] Recovery point objectives (RPO) acceptable for compliance

## üìä Compliance Verification

### Data Protection Regulations

- [ ] **GDPR Article 32**: Technical measures for data security ‚úÖ
- [ ] **CCPA Section 1798.150**: Consumer data protection ‚úÖ
- [ ] **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls for sensitive data ‚úÖ
- [ ] **ISO 27001**: Information security controls ‚úÖ

### Documentation

- [ ] Encryption implementation documented for auditors
- [ ] Key management procedures documented
- [ ] Incident response procedures include encryption scenarios
- [ ] Data retention policies updated for encrypted audit logs

## üîç Post-Deployment Validation

### Week 1

- [ ] Monitor encryption success rates (should be 100%)
- [ ] Verify no plaintext PII in audit logs
- [ ] Check application performance impact (should be minimal)
- [ ] Validate backup and monitoring systems

### Month 1

- [ ] Review audit access patterns and permissions
- [ ] Analyze storage growth and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Test key rotation procedures
- [ ] Conduct security assessment of encryption implementation

### Quarterly

- [ ] Security audit of audit log encryption
- [ ] Performance review and optimization
- [ ] Compliance verification with relevant regulations
- [ ] Update encryption procedures based on industry best practices

## üìù Sign-off

- [ ] **Security Team**: Encryption implementation reviewed and approved
- [ ] **DevOps Team**: Deployment procedures tested and documented
- [ ] **Compliance Team**: Regulatory requirements verified
- [ ] **Management**: Production deployment authorized
