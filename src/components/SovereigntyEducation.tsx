      <h4 className="text-base font-semibold">Journey to Sovereignty</h4>
      <p>
        Planting the seeds of self-sovereignty that can eventually grow into their Family's Tree of Liberty providing fruit we may never harvest to our descendants we become siege-proof, secured against isolation, reputational, financial, and eventually physical attacks. Building the Foundations our Federations, Mints, and Webs of Trust are built on as our knowledge, competence, and confidence grow step by step along this quest designed to create a resilient dynastic family business that endures the tests of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solving the '3-generation Problem' (with ~$84T in wealth to transfer over the next two decades) to those who've not earned their wealth likely can't/won't defend what they didn't put the work in to create, the 'Great Disillusionment' AI generated deepfakes making ALL untrusted digital communication untrustworthy creates, combined with the peaceful financial revolution bitcoin's innovations bring to families and businesses. Simply by attacking the centralists' divide-n-conquer strategy, empowering strong, responsible, and courageous families to rule over their realms of influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who've done the work to earn it, our reputational, physical, financial, and cognitive capital are passed down, to our descendants by blood and/or spiritual kinship. Establishing control of the territory our identity, credentials, and custody are cultivated in, by publishing our 'True Name' WE have selected for ourselves and/or our beneficiaries and allies. Doing so by completing the creation, credentialization, and custody of our selves, our Webs of Trust, and our Badges of Honor archiving our progress on the Road to Self-Sovereignty, as we progress to Stewardship into Guardianship roles for those who've entrusted us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Quest for Control of our destiny must be personally traveled by each peer in this realm, as we each become responsible for our own bitcoin and Nostr keys, LN node, and multi-sig/single signature mint credentials rests on the shoulders of all who dare to aspire to found a family dynasty that provides lasting value to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must learn to trust, but collateralize, ourselves, our counterparties, and our custodians, Stewards, and Guardians; strategically deciding if/when/how much we choose to trust them, doing so at a minimum with reputational capital at stake, but also often physical and financial security, 'staked in the game' by participants in it.
