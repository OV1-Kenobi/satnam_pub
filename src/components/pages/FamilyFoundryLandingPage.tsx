                  Most wealthy families eventually lose the plot because they try to make the family purely emotional, or purely corporate. <strong className="text-white">Both are wrong.</strong>
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The purely emotional family operates on feelings, nostalgia, and unspoken expectations. There are no clear roles, no documented processes, no accountability structures. Decisions are made based on who speaks loudest or who guilt-trips most effectively. Money flows based on sentiment rather than strategy. This creates resentment, confusion, and eventuallyâ€”collapse.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The purely corporate family treats relationships like transactions. Everything is measured, optimized, and monetized. Family dinners feel like board meetings. Children are raised like employees. Love is conditional on performance metrics. This creates emotional distance, rebellion, and a legacy that feels hollowâ€”even when the balance sheet looks impressive.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong className="text-white">A successful legacy must be operationally efficient AND spiritually anchored.</strong> Without structure, familiarity turns into dysfunction, and money becomes the battleground. Without soul, the family becomes cold, performative, and extractive.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  This is why the greatest families in historyâ€”from the Medici to the Rothschilds, from ancient dynasties to modern family officesâ€”understood that you must <strong className="text-white">run the family like a business, but govern it like a kingdom.</strong>
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The business side provides: clear roles, documented systems, transparent ledgers, annual reviews, formalized succession planning, and legacy planning that extends beyond the founders. This is the operational backbone that prevents chaos.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The kingdom side provides: meetings that open with blessing and ceremony, roles inherited with ritual and reverence, elders consulted with honor, and sacred stewardship of resources. This is the spiritual anchor that prevents soullessness.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                  <strong className="text-white">When both live in balance</strong>, you create a lineage that knows its mission, a treasury that funds generational vision, and a culture of reverenceâ€”not just ROI. You create a family that can weather storms, navigate transitions, and build something that lasts beyond your lifetime.

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-lg">
                  <strong className="text-white">Children raised in chaos become adults who resist governance.</strong> The home is the first kingdom. There is no dynasty without order, and there is no order without structure that starts inside the home.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Many modern parents fear structure. They worry it will stifle creativity, damage self-esteem, or create resentment. So they opt for permissiveness disguised as "freedom." They let children interrupt adult conversations. They negotiate with toddlers. They avoid consequences because they want to be liked. They create homes where chaos is normalized and boundaries are optional.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The result? Children who grow up unable to self-regulate, unable to delay gratification, unable to respect authority, and unable to lead themselvesâ€”let alone lead others. These children become adults who resist any form of governance because they never learned to govern themselves.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong className="text-white">Children are shaped by what happens repeatedly</strong>â€”not by what you say occasionally. They learn from patterns, not promises. They internalize what is consistently enforced, not what is occasionally mentioned.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Does "no" mean no? Or does it mean "maybe if you whine enough"? Are interruptions corrected immediately, or tolerated until frustration boils over? Are parents in alignment on rules and consequences, or do children learn to play one against the other? Do mornings have rhythm and routine, or is every day a chaotic scramble? Do consequences follow through consistently, or are they threatened but rarely enforced?
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Structure in the home doesn't mean military rigidity. It means predictable rhythms, clear expectations, consistent consequences, and aligned leadership. It means children know what to expect, what is expected of them, and what happens when expectations aren't met.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong className="text-white">Govern the home. Govern early. Govern quietlyâ€”but without apology.</strong> Start when they're young, before bad habits calcify. Govern with calm consistency, not emotional outbursts. Govern without needing to justify every decision to a five-year-old.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                  Children raised in structure don't become robotic. They become <strong className="text-white">sovereign</strong>. They learn self-discipline, delayed gratification, respect for authority, and the capacity to lead. They become adults who can govern themselves, their families, and their wealthâ€”because they learned governance at home.

              <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold text-orange-400 mb-6">Code #006: Wealth Is Not the Goal. Stewardship Is.</h3>
              <div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-lg">
                  <strong className="text-white">Most stop at acquisition. Dynasties begin at administration.</strong> Wealth can be made in one generation, but it is rarely kept without structure, philosophy, and ritual.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The first generation builds. They hustle, sacrifice, take risks, and accumulate. They focus on making moneyâ€”and they're often very good at it. But making money and keeping money are two entirely different skill sets.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The second generation inherits. They didn't build it, so they don't have the same relationship with it. They may respect it, or they may resent it. They may preserve it, or they may squander it. Without intentional stewardship training, they often do bothâ€”preserving some while squandering the rest.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The third generation destroys. This is the infamous "shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations" pattern. By the third generation, the wealth is goneâ€”not because they're stupid, but because <strong className="text-white">no one taught them stewardship.</strong>
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Families who last more than three generations understand something fundamental: <strong className="text-white">wealth is not the finish line. It is the foundation.</strong> The goal is not to accumulate as much as possible. The goal is to create a system that preserves, grows, and deploys wealth in alignment with family valuesâ€”across generations.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  These families focus on <strong className="text-white">how wealth is held, where it flows, who has access, what it's aligned to, and why.</strong> They create:

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2 ml-4">
                  <li><strong className="text-white">Trusts</strong> that protect assets from creditors, lawsuits, and poor decisions</li>
                  <li><strong className="text-white">Family constitutions</strong> that codify values, governance structures, and decision-making processes</li>
                  <li><strong className="text-white">Education programs</strong> that train each generation in financial literacy, business acumen, and stewardship principles</li>
                  <li><strong className="text-white">Governance councils</strong> that make major decisions collectively, not individually</li>
                  <li><strong className="text-white">Rituals and ceremonies</strong> that reinforce family identity and values</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  They ensure every major financial decision echoes back to <strong className="text-white">legacyâ€”not lifestyle.</strong> They don't ask, "Can we afford this?" They ask, "Does this serve the lineage?"
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  They understand that wealth without stewardship becomes a curse. It creates entitlement, destroys work ethic, and breeds resentment. But wealth WITH stewardship becomes a tool for multigenerational impact.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-100 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                  The goal is not more. <strong className="text-white">The goal is meaningful continuity.</strong> Stewardship is the difference between inheritance and chaos.
