## Security & Privacy

### üîê **Zero-Knowledge Security Model**

Satnam.pub implements a zero-knowledge security model where:

- No passwords are stored on the server
- All authentication uses cryptographic signatures
- Private keys remain under user control
- Recovery systems use encrypted backups
- No external logging or analytics
- Programmable data deletion controls
- Verifiable client-side operations
In the pipeline:
- **zk-SNARKs** for transaction verification without revealing amounts or participants
- **Bulletproofs** for range proofs to verify transaction validity without exposing values
- **zk-STARKs** for scalable, transparent verification of complex operations
- **Blind signature schemes** for privacy-preserving authentication
- **Homomorphic encryption** for secure computations without data exposure

### üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy-First Security Features**
