## Overview

Satnam.pub is a Bitcoin-only, privacy-first, sovereign family banking and identity platform that empowers families and individuals to create and manage decentralized digital identities and finances without relying on custodial services. Built exclusively on Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr, and eCash protocols, the platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools for identity forging, education, family coordination, and financial sovereignty.

The project combines the security and sovereignty of Bitcoin with the interoperability of Nostr to create human-readable addresses, family dashboards, and educational resources - all while maintaining complete user control over private keys, identity data, and financial information.

Whether you're a Bitcoin beginner seeking education or an advanced user coordinating family security, Satnam.pub provides the tools to build your digital dynasty with pure Bitcoin sovereignty and uncompromising privacy.

- Integration tests: `**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts`
- Component tests: `**/*.test.tsx`

## Quick Start

### 1. Forge Your Identity

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and click "Forge Identity" to create your sovereign digital identity:

```typescript
// Example: Creating a new identity
const identity = await forgeIdentity({
  username: "satoshi",
  familyName: "nakamoto",
  recoveryPassword: "your-secure-recovery-password",
});
```

### 2. Authentication Methods

**Option A: NIP-07 Browser Extension (Recommended)**

```typescript
// Sign authentication challenge with browser extension
const challenge = await getAuthChallenge(npub);
const signature = await window.nostr.signEvent(challenge);
const token = await authenticate(npub, signature);
```

**Option B: Direct nsec Import**

```typescript
// Import private key directly (only in secure contexts)
const identity = await importIdentity(nsec);
const token = await authenticateWithNsec(nsec);
```

**Option C: One-Time Password via Nostr DM**

```typescript
// Request OTP
await requestOTP(npub);
// Check your Nostr DMs for the code
const token = await authenticateWithOTP(npub, otpCode);
```

### 3. Family Dashboard Access

After authentication, access your family dashboard to:

- View family members and their Bitcoin addresses
- Coordinate multi-signature setups
- Share educational resources
- Monitor Lightning Network activity
- Manage privacy settings and data deletion

### 4. Recovery Process

If you lose access, use the recovery system:

```typescript
// Recover identity using backup
const recoveredIdentity = await recoverIdentity(
  username,
  recoveryPassword,
  encryptedBackup
);
```

- **Secure Enclaves**: Isolated execution environments for sensitive operations
- **Forward Secrecy**: Protection of past communications if keys are compromised

### üîç **Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation**

Satnam.pub leverages zero-knowledge proofs in several key areas, with a comprehensive audit process starting Q3 2025 (seeking user feedback on potential audit partners):

1. **Transaction Verification** (zk-SNARKs) - Phase 1, Current-Q3 2025

   - Verify Lightning payment amounts without revealing values
   - Confirm transaction history without exposing transaction graph
   - Validate spending limits compliance without revealing actual spending

2. **Identity & Authentication** (Bulletproofs) - Phase 2, Q4 2025

   - Age verification without revealing birth date
   - Guardian approval without exposing transaction details
   - Account ownership proof without linking identities

3. **Family Treasury Management** (zk-STARKs) - Phase 3, Q2 2026

   - Multi-signature verification without revealing individual signatures
   - Treasury balance verification without exposing actual amounts
   - Spending policy compliance without revealing transaction details

4. **Fedimint & Cashu Integration** - Phase 4, Q4 2026
   - Blind issuance and redemption of eCash tokens
   - Federated custody verification without revealing guardian identities
   - Cross-federation transfers without exposing source/destination

### üìä **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**

Satnam.pub implements a unique approach to analytics that preserves privacy:

- **Local-Only Analytics**: All usage data stays on your device
- **Differential Privacy**: Any shared metrics have mathematical privacy guarantees
- **Aggregated Insights**: Only non-identifying statistical data is processed
- **Opt-In Only**: All analytics are disabled by default and require explicit consent
- **Self-Sovereign Data**: View and delete your own analytics data at any time
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify system health without exposing individual data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Guidelines**

Please review our comprehensive [Security Guidelines](SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md) before using the platform. Key points:

- Never enter your private key on HTTP websites
- Use incognito/private browsing mode
- Avoid public WiFi for sensitive operations
- Consider using Nostr browser extensions
- Always verify you're on the correct domain
- All destructive operations have rollback instructions
- Use hardware security devices when available
- Regularly rotate encryption keys for long-term storage

### üö® **Security Reporting**
