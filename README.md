## Overview

Satnam.pub is a sovereign Bitcoin identity platform that empowers families and individuals to create and manage decentralized digital identities without relying on custodial services. Built on Bitcoin and the Nostr protocol, the platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools for identity forging, education, family coordination, and account recovery.

The project combines the security and sovereignty of Bitcoin with the interoperability of Nostr to create human-readable addresses, family dashboards, and educational resources - all while maintaining complete user control over private keys and identity data.

Whether you're a Bitcoin beginner seeking education or an advanced user coordinating family security, Satnam.pub provides the tools to build your digital dynasty with pure Bitcoin sovereignty.

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satnam-recovery.git
   cd satnam-recovery
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Database Setup**

   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   npm run db:setup
   ```

5. **Start development servers**

   ```bash
   # Frontend development server (port 3000)
   npm run dev

   # Backend API server (port 8000)
   npm run server:dev
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. **Build the application**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start production server**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

## Quick Start

### 1. Forge Your Identity

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and click "Forge Identity" to create your sovereign digital identity:

```typescript
// Example: Creating a new identity
const identity = await forgeIdentity({
  username: "satoshi",
  familyName: "nakamoto",
  recoveryPassword: "your-secure-recovery-password",
});
```

### 2. Authentication Methods

**Option A: Nostr Wallet Connect (Recommended)**

```typescript
// Sign authentication challenge
const challenge = await getAuthChallenge(npub);
const signature = await signChallenge(challenge, privateKey);
const token = await authenticate(npub, signature);
```

**Option B: One-Time Password via Nostr DM**

```typescript
// Request OTP
await requestOTP(npub);
// Check your Nostr DMs for the code
const token = await authenticateWithOTP(npub, otpCode);
```

### 3. Family Dashboard Access

After authentication, access your family dashboard to:

- View family members and their Bitcoin addresses
- Coordinate multi-signature setups
- Share educational resources
- Monitor Lightning Network activity

### 4. Recovery Process

If you lose access, use the recovery system:

```typescript
// Recover identity using backup
const recoveredIdentity = await recoverIdentity(
  username,
  recoveryPassword,
  encryptedBackup
);
```

## Security

### 🔐 **Security Model**

Satnam.pub implements a zero-knowledge security model where:

- No passwords are stored on the server
- All authentication uses cryptographic signatures
- Private keys remain under user control
- Recovery systems use encrypted backups

### 🛡️ **Security Features**

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All connections use TLS encryption
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT tokens with automatic expiration
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy for XSS prevention

### ⚠️ **Security Guidelines**

Please review our comprehensive [Security Guidelines](SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md) before using the platform. Key points:

- Never enter your private key on HTTP websites
- Use incognito/private browsing mode
- Avoid public WiFi for sensitive operations
- Consider using Nostr browser extensions
- Always verify you're on the correct domain

### 🚨 **Security Reporting**
