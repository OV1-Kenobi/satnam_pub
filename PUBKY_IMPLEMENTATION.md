# Pubky Protocol Implementation

This document provides an overview of the Pubky protocol implementation in the Sovereign Bitcoin Identity Forge project.

## Overview

The Pubky protocol is a decentralized domain management system that uses public key cryptography to provide sovereign control over domains and content. It integrates with PKARR (Public Key Addressable Resource Records) for distributed DNS and provides a high level of sovereignty compared to traditional domain systems.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Enhanced Pubky Client (`lib/pubky-enhanced-client.ts`)

A complete implementation of the Pubky protocol with the following features:

#### PUBKY CORE FEATURES
- Full PKARR (Public Key Addressable Resource Records) support
- Pubky homeserver communication for key-based routing
- pubky:// URL resolution and content publishing
- Ed25519 keypair management with cryptographic signatures
- PKARR relay network integration for distributed DNS

#### ADVANCED FEATURES
- Pubky domain registration with cryptographic ownership proof
- Content addressing and retrieval via pubky:// URLs
- Peer-to-peer content routing through Pubky network
- Integration with existing domain sovereignty scoring
- Backup and recovery for Pubky domains and content

#### SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
- Ed25519 keypair generation and management
- Cryptographic domain ownership verification
- Secure homeserver communication protocols
- Content integrity verification and authentication
- Key rotation and recovery procedures

#### INTEGRATION POINTS
- Connection with existing family federation system
- Integration with PostgreSQL for metadata storage
- Support for migration from traditional DNS to Pubky domains
- Family domain sharing and inheritance

### 2. Existing PubkyClient Integration (`services/domain/PubkyClient.ts`)

The existing PubkyClient class has been updated to use the enhanced implementation internally while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.

### 3. Tests (`tests/pubky-enhanced-client.test.ts`)

Comprehensive tests for the enhanced Pubky client implementation.

### 4. Example (`examples/pubky-example.ts`)

A complete example demonstrating how to use the enhanced Pubky client.
