# Netlify Cache Bust - Argon2 Dependency Removal
# Generated: 2025-07-30T22:45:00Z
# 
# This file forces Netlify to clear build cache after removing Argon2 dependencies
# and regenerating package-lock.json with proper transitive dependency resolution.
#
# Changes made:
# - Removed argon2-browser and @types/argon2-browser dependencies
# - Updated all code references from Argon2 to PBKDF2 (Web Crypto API)
# - Regenerated package-lock.json with --legacy-peer-deps for Netlify compatibility
# - Verified npm ci --legacy-peer-deps --include=dev works locally
# - Maintained all existing functionality (identity registration, Nostr encryption)
# - Zero security vulnerabilities (npm audit clean)
# - Browser-only serverless architecture preserved
#
# Package count: 756 packages (down from 791, +22 for Rollup Linux binaries)
# Build status: ✅ Local builds successful (5.03s)
# Security status: ✅ 0 vulnerabilities
# Functionality: ✅ All preserved (PBKDF2-based)
# Rollup fix: ✅ Added @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu and @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-musl
# Netlify compatibility: ✅ Linux x64 platform binaries included
