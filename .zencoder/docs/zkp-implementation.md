# Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation in Satnam.pub

This document provides detailed technical information about the implementation, deployment, and auditing of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in the Satnam.pub platform.

## Implementation Architecture

| Technology                 | Use Case                 | Implementation   | Status                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **zk-SNARKs**              | Transaction verification | circom + snarkjs | Phase 1 - Active      |
| **Bulletproofs**           | Range proofs             | bulletproofs-js  | Phase 1 - Active      |
| **zk-STARKs**              | Complex operations       | stark-wasm       | Phase 2 - Development |
| **Blind Signatures**       | Authentication           | noble-secp256k1  | Phase 1 - Active      |
| **Homomorphic Encryption** | Secure computation       | TFHE-rs (WASM)   | Phase 3 - Planning    |

### Client-Side Implementation

All ZKP operations in Satnam.pub are implemented client-side to ensure that sensitive data never leaves the user's device:

```typescript
// Example: Transaction amount verification using zk-SNARKs
import * as snarkjs from "snarkjs";

async function generateTransactionProof(
  amount: number,
  limit: number
): Promise<ZKProof> {
  // Load the circuit
  const circuit = await fetch("/circuits/transaction-verification.json").then(
    (r) => r.json()
  );

  // Generate witness
  const witness = {
    amount: amount,
    limit: limit,
    // Private inputs not shared with verifier
    sender_id: currentUser.id,
    recipient_id: recipient.id,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  };

  // Generate proof
  const { proof, publicSignals } = await snarkjs.groth16.fullProve(
    witness,
    circuit,
    "/circuits/transaction-verification.zkey"
  );

  return {
    proof,
    publicSignals: {
      isValid: publicSignals[0], // Boolean: is amount <= limit
      // No amount or user data exposed
    },
  };
}
```

### WebAssembly Optimization

ZKP operations are computationally intensive. To ensure good performance in browser environments, we use WebAssembly:

```typescript
// Loading optimized WASM modules for ZKP operations
import { initializeWasm } from "./wasm-loader";

// Initialize WebAssembly modules on application start
async function initializeZKPModules() {
  await initializeWasm("/wasm/snarkjs.wasm");
  await initializeWasm("/wasm/bulletproofs.wasm");

  // Pre-load commonly used circuits
  await preloadCircuit("transaction-verification");
  await preloadCircuit("identity-verification");
  await preloadCircuit("age-verification");
}
```

## Deployment Architecture

### Proof Generation Flow

1. **Client-Side Preparation**

   - User initiates action requiring verification (e.g., transaction)
   - Client collects necessary inputs while keeping sensitive data private
   - WebAssembly modules generate the ZKP locally

2. **Proof Submission**

   - Only the proof and public inputs are transmitted
   - No private data leaves the device
   - Proofs are transmitted via end-to-end encrypted channels

3. **Verification**
   - Proofs can be verified by:
     - Other family members (for family operations)
     - Fedimint guardians (for federation operations)
     - Lightning nodes (for payment verification)
     - Cashu mints (for eCash operations)

## Specific ZKP Applications

### 1. Transaction Verification

**When Used**: Every time a family member initiates a transaction that requires verification against spending limits or policies.

**How Implemented**:

- zk-SNARKs verify that transaction amount is within limits without revealing the amount
- Proof shows compliance with family treasury rules without exposing transaction details
- Guardian approval can be given based on proofs without seeing sensitive information

**Example Circuit**:

```circom
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template TransactionVerification() {
    // Private inputs
    signal input amount;
    signal input daily_limit;
    signal input daily_spent;
    signal input user_id;

    // Public inputs/outputs
    signal output is_within_limit;
    signal output is_authorized_user;

    // Verification logic
    is_within_limit <== (daily_spent + amount) <= daily_limit;
    is_authorized_user <== user_id > 0; // Simplified; actual implementation checks against authorized list
}

component main = TransactionVerification();
```

### 2. Age Verification

**When Used**: When accessing age-restricted content or features without revealing actual age.

**How Implemented**:

- Bulletproofs verify that user's age is above threshold without revealing birth date
- Proof can be generated once and reused across multiple verifications
- No age or identity information is stored centrally

### 3. Guardian Approval

**When Used**: When a transaction requires multi-signature approval from family guardians.

**How Implemented**:

- zk-STARKs verify that required threshold of guardians have approved
- Individual guardian identities and approval patterns remain private
- Approval can be verified without revealing which specific guardians approved

## Auditing Process

### Formal Verification

All ZKP circuits undergo formal verification to ensure mathematical correctness:

1. **Static Analysis**

   - Automated analysis of circuit constraints
   - Verification of cryptographic assumptions
   - Checking for potential side-channel vulnerabilities

2. **Symbolic Execution**
   - Testing circuits with symbolic inputs
   - Verification of all possible execution paths
   - Ensuring no unexpected behaviors

### Independent Security Audits

Our ZKP implementation undergoes rigorous third-party audits:

1. **Proposed Audit Partners** (Seeking User Feedback)

   - Least Authority (specialized in zero-knowledge cryptography)
   - Trail of Bits (for general cryptographic review)
   - ZKP specialists from the academic community
   - Other potential partners under consideration (we welcome your suggestions)

2. **Audit Schedule**

   - Initial comprehensive audit: Completed Q2 2025
   - Comprehensive audit process: Starting Q3 2025 (in progress now)
   - Release target: End of Q3 2025 (potentially sooner based on audit results)
   - Ongoing quarterly reviews following initial release

3. **Audit Scope**
   - Cryptographic implementation correctness
   - Side-channel vulnerability assessment
   - Performance and resource usage analysis
   - Verification of trusted setup procedures (for zk-SNARKs)
