# Satnam.pub Sovereign Family Banking & Identity Forge ‚Äî Master Agent Context

## üö® CRITICAL: READ BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES

This document serves as the master context for all development work on the Satnam.pub sovereign family banking platform. **NEVER deviate from these protocols without explicit approval.**

---

## Mission & Core Principles

**Mission:**  
Satnam.pub is a Bitcoin-only, privacy-first, sovereign family banking and identity platform. The codebase is architected for maximum user sovereignty, minimal third-party trust, and full self-authentication, as well as progressive self-custody. All communications and payments are built on open protocols‚ÄîBitcoin, Lightning, Nostr, and Chaumian eCash‚Äîwithout altcoins or unnecessary intermediaries.

**Key Principles:**

- **Bitcoin-only:** No altcoins, no tokens. All payment and authentication is Bitcoin-native and denominated in satoshis as the standard unit of account (on and off-chain Bitcoin, Fedimint, Cashu).
- **Privacy-first:** End-to-end encryption, metadata minimization, no external logging, and user-controlled data, private by default.
- **Sovereignty:** Users control their keys, identities, and funds. No custodial risk, no vendor lock-in.
- **Auditability:** All code, infrastructure, and flows are transparent, documented, and verifiable both personally and programatically.
- **Modularity:** Clear separation of frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Netlify Functions). No Node.js server code in the frontend.

## Technical Architecture

### Browser-Based Serverless Environment

- **ONLY** use browser-compatible APIs - Web Crypto API, fetch, localStorage
- **NO** Node.js modules: crypto, events, fs, path, stream, util
- **NO** polyfills or Node.js compatibility layers
- All frontend code must be browser-only (React/Vite)
- All backend logic in Netlify Functions
- Use TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) for components, JavaScript (.js) for API routes
- Strict separation of concerns, barrel files for all modules

### File Structure Compliance

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/           # React components (.tsx)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                  # Utility functions (.ts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                # TypeScript definitions (.ts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                # React hooks (.ts)

```

## Security & Privacy Protocols

### Privacy-First Architecture

- **NEVER** log user data, transaction details, or family information
- **NO** external logging services or third-party analytics
- Use Supabase Vault for all sensitive credentials
- Implement data minimization - collect only essential information
- All communications must use NIP-59 Gift Wrapped messaging
- Provide programmable deletability controls for all user data with a unified deletion modal
- Client-side verification for all security operations
- User-controlled, locally-stored encrypted audit logs (optional)
- Differential privacy techniques for any aggregated data
- Ephemeral computing - process data in memory without persistence
- Secure multi-party computation for collaborative operations
- Plausible deniability features for sensitive operations

### Encryption & Security Standards

- Use Web Crypto API for all cryptographic operations
- AES-256-GCM for data encryption
- Store secrets in Supabase Vault, **NOT** .env files
- Implement end-to-end encryption for all family communications
- Privacy metrics for all communications and transactions
- HTTPS enforcement with strict TLS requirements
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for XSS prevention
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Secure JWT token management with automatic expiration
- All destructive operations must have rollback instructions

### Authentication Layers

1. **NIP-07** Browser extension signing
2. **Direct nsec import** For secure key management
3. **OTP invitation** For secure onboarding
4. **Hardware security** Integration (future)

### Secure Family Operations

1. **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** For family treasury management
2. **Threshold Signatures** For distributed approval without revealing keys
3. **Blind Custody** For parental controls without visibility into child transactions
4. **Privacy-Preserving Verification** For age/identity verification without data exposure

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Deployment

1. **Client-Side ZKP Generation**

   - All proofs generated in browser using WebAssembly
   - No server-side proof generation to prevent data leakage
   - Optimized for mobile devices with limited computational resources

2. **Verification Infrastructure**

   - Decentralized verification through Nostr relays
   - Trustless verification without central authority
   - Federated verification for family operations

3. **ZKP Libraries & Implementation**

   - **circom** and **snarkjs** for zk-SNARK implementations
   - **bulletproofs-js** for range proofs
   - **stark-wasm** for transparent proofs
   - Custom WebAssembly optimizations for browser performance

4. **Deployment Phases**
   - **Phase 1 (Current - Q3 2025)**: Basic transaction verification proofs
   - **Phase 2 (Q4 2025)**: Identity and authentication proofs
   - **Phase 3 (Q2 2026)**: Full treasury management with ZKP
   - **Phase 4 (Q4 2026)**: Cross-protocol ZKP for Lightning/Cashu/Fedimint

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Auditing

1. **Formal Verification**

   - Mathematical verification of ZKP circuits
   - Formal proof of security properties
   - Verification of cryptographic assumptions

2. **Independent Security Audits**

   - Proposed audit partners (seeking user feedback):
     - Least Authority audit of ZKP implementation
     - Trail of Bits review of cryptographic protocols
     - Other potential partners under consideration
   - Comprehensive audit process starting Q3 2025
   - Initial audit completed Q2 2025
   - Open-source community review process

3. **Continuous Verification**

   - Automated testing of all ZKP circuits
   - Fuzzing of proof generation and verification
   - Stress testing under various network conditions

4. **Transparent Audit Reports**

   - All audit reports published publicly
   - Detailed explanation of findings and remediations
   - Regular re-auditing on major version updates

5. **User Verification Tools**
   - Self-verification tools for users to validate ZKP implementation
   - Transparency logs for ZKP verification
   - Educational resources on understanding ZKP security

## Development Protocols

### TypeScript Standards

- Always define proper interfaces for all data structures
- Use strict type checking
- Export types from `src/types/` directory
- Handle undefined/null states explicitly
- Use `.boltignore` optimization for AI context window

### Error Prevention

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Proper type definitions
interface FamilyMember {
  id: string;
  npub: string;
  username: string;
  role: 'parent' | 'child' | 'guardian';
  spendingLimits?: {
    daily: number;
    weekly: number;
    requiresApproval: number;
  };
}

// ‚ùå WRONG: Any types or missing definitions
const member: any = {...}
```

### Destructive Operations

- All destructive operations must have rollback instructions
- Must be verified before and after execution
- Provide clear documentation for recovery procedures
- Test in isolation before integration
