  <h1>Bitcoin Trust Administration – In-Development Concept Note</h1>
  <p><strong>Audience:</strong> Professional Bitcoin trust & fiduciary service providers (e.g., Bespoke Group, Onramp Bitcoin).</p>
  <p><em>Educational material – in development now. Forward-looking architecture overview, not legal, tax, or investment advice.</em></p>
  <hr />
  <h2>1. Executive Overview</h2>
  <p>This note outlines how Satnam’s <strong>Blinded Authentication × Sig4Sats</strong> stack can support Bitcoin education trusts and similar structures.</p>
  <p><strong>Core objectives:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encode trust mandates as <strong>machine-verifiable contracts</strong>, not just PDFs and email threads.</li>
    <li>Require <strong>bonded N-of-M approvals</strong> from trustees for high-impact actions.</li>
    <li>Deliver funds via <strong>privacy-preserving Lightning / Cashu rails</strong> instead of surveilled banking rails.</li>
    <li>Maintain a <strong>tamper-evident but minimal audit trail</strong> for heirs, co-trustees, and auditors.</li>
    <li>Enable <strong>safe automation</strong> via a constrained AI “trust officer” agent.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2>2. Education Trust Use Case at a Glance</h2>
  <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A family education trust funds a beneficiary’s studies over many years. Distributions are tied to milestones such as enrollment, academic progress, and graduation.</p>
  <p><strong>Actors:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trust / trust company (modeled as a “family federation”).</li>
    <li>Trustees / investment committee (guardian/steward roles).</li>
    <li>Beneficiary (offspring/adult role).</li>
    <li>Optional AI “trust officer” agent operating under capped permissions.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2>3. How the Architecture Works (Phases 0–4)</h2>
  <h3>3.1 Phase 0 – Setup</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Map trust, trustees, and beneficiary into Satnam’s privacy-first identity model with role-based permissions.</li>
    <li>Associate a dedicated <strong>LNbits wallet</strong> and/or Cashu balances with the trust for distributions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> The legal trust structure has a clean, role-based representation without exposing real-world names in application-level logs.</p>
  <h3>3.2 Phase 1 – Policy &amp; Escrow</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Trustees co-author an <strong>Education Trust Policy</strong> event (beneficiary hash, milestones, payout rules, N-of-M approvals).</li>
    <li>Using <strong>attestation credits</strong>, the policy and (optionally) hashes of legal documents are <strong>timestamped and anchored</strong>.</li>
    <li>Trust assets earmarked for education are converted to <strong>Cashu ecash</strong> and bound via <strong>Sig4Sats</strong> to the policy event, creating a <strong>cryptographically committed reward pool</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Future disputes are resolved by inspecting anchored policy events and escrow commitments, not debating email trails.</p>
  <h3>3.3 Phase 2 – Milestone Claim &amp; Verification</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The beneficiary (or a delegated steward) submits a private <strong>Milestone Claim</strong> event referencing the policy and including encrypted hashes of supporting documents.</li>
    <li>Trustees review evidence off-platform and, if satisfied, sign a <strong>Milestone Verified</strong> event.</li>
    <li>The trust spends <strong>attestation credits</strong> to anchor that a threshold of trustees verified this milestone.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Clear, time-stamped evidence that trustees verified a specific milestone under a specific policy, without exposing beneficiary identities or documents to third parties.</p>
  <h3>3.4 Phase 3 – Bonded Trustee Approvals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For each major payout, trustees receive a <strong>Sig4Sats approval offer</strong>: stake a small <strong>Cashu bond</strong> and sign a <strong>Milestone Payout Authorization</strong> event.</li>
    <li>Each trustee who agrees stakes their bond and produces a Sig4Sats-backed approval; once <strong>N-of-M</strong> are collected, the system verifies both signatures and bonded stakes.</li>
    <li>A blind-issuer function then mints a one-time, <strong>blinded payout capability token</strong> representing authorization for this specific distribution.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Approvals are no longer soft signals; each trustee now has economic skin-in-the-game, with an independent record of who approved what, when, and under which policy.</p>
  <h3>3.5 Phase 4 – Distribution to Beneficiary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The beneficiary’s wallet (or a designated agent) presents the <strong>blinded payout token</strong> to a payout function.</li>
    <li>The backend validates the token and executes the payout via <strong>Lightning (LNbits)</strong> or <strong>Cashu release</strong>, then marks the token as spent.</li>
    <li>Optionally, another small <strong>attestation</strong> records that this milestone was paid out under a specific policy and date.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Beneficiaries receive funds via privacy-preserving rails; trustees and auditors retain a precise, cryptographically verifiable record of what was authorized and executed.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>4. Extension A – Ongoing Stipends via Blinded Allowance Tokens</h2>
  <p>After a major milestone payout, trustees may provide <strong>ongoing stipends</strong> (e.g., monthly living expenses) with strong controls and privacy.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trustees allocate a portion of remaining escrow to a dedicated <strong>stipend pool</strong> and define a <strong>Stipend Policy</strong> (cadence, caps, duration).</li>
    <li>Using <strong>Sig4Sats</strong> and the stipend policy event, the trust converts Cashu funds into a batch of <strong>Blinded Allowance Tokens</strong> assigned to the beneficiary.</li>
    <li>The beneficiary’s wallet holds these tokens; each LN payment or Cashu withdrawal for living expenses <strong>consumes one allowance token</strong> in addition to normal authentication.</li>
    <li>The system records only <strong>spent-token hashes and aggregate counts</strong>, not detailed merchant histories.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Trustees can cap monthly or semester allowances with cryptographic guarantees while beneficiaries retain meaningful financial privacy.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>5. Extension B – Trusted AI “Trust Officer” Agent</h2>
  <p>A Satnam-integrated AI agent can act as a <strong>“trust officer”</strong> under strict cryptographic constraints rather than unbounded API access.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Powers:</strong> No master keys or root credentials; limited access to specific <strong>attestation credits</strong> and bounded sets of <strong>allowance and payout tokens</strong>, plus read-only access to policy and milestone events.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Monitor upcoming milestones, pre-compute Sig4Sats offers and bond suggestions, execute <strong>low-risk, pre-approved stipends</strong> within caps, and use its own attestation credits to timestamp key decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Governance:</strong> If the AI misbehaves or is compromised, damage is capped by the tokens it can access; trustees can revoke or rotate its capabilities by rotating token sets.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2>6. Why This Matters for Bitcoin Trust Providers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stronger internal controls</strong>: Bonded N-of-M approvals and programmable policies, enforced at the cryptographic level.</li>
    <li><strong>Better records</strong>: Cryptographic attestations instead of ambiguous email trails, with minimal data exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved client privacy</strong>: Beneficiaries avoid surveillance-heavy banking rails while still receiving verifiable distributions.</li>
    <li><strong>Safe automation</strong>: AI agents operate within hard, revocable limits defined by blinded tokens and attestation budgets.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This in-development architecture is designed to support existing fiduciary obligations—not bypass them—while giving clients and their families a modern, privacy-respecting trust experience built on Bitcoin, Lightning, and ecash primitives.</p>
