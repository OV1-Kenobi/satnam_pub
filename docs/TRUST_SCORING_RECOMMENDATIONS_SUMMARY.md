# Trust Scoring Enhancement - Prioritized Recommendations

**Analysis Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Recommendation Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Overall Priority**: HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing Brainstorm.world and NIP-85 Trusted Assertions, we recommend a **phased integration approach** that:

1. ✅ Maintains Satnam.pub's zero-knowledge architecture
2. ✅ Leverages existing Noble V2 encryption standards
3. ✅ Integrates seamlessly with CEPS
4. ✅ Preserves privacy-first principles
5. ✅ Enables decentralized trust distribution

---

## Priority 1: NIP-85 Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Recommendation: Implement NIP-85 Publishing

**Why**: Enables decentralized trust score distribution without central database dependency

**What to Build**:
- [ ] NIP85PublishingService (publish kind 30382/30383/30384 events)
- [ ] Kind 10040 provider management
- [ ] Database schema for assertions and providers
- [ ] CEPS extensions for NIP-85 operations

**Expected Outcome**:
- Trust scores published to Nostr network
- Multiple relay support
- Cryptographic verification of all assertions
- Foundation for client interoperability

**Effort**: 2 weeks | **Risk**: Low | **Impact**: High

---

## Priority 2: Multi-Metric Trust (Weeks 3-4)

### Recommendation: Extend Trust Scoring Beyond Action-Based

**Why**: Provides richer trust signals (followers, network distance, influence)

**What to Build**:
- [ ] EnhancedTrustScoringService with multi-metric calculation
- [ ] Network distance calculation (hops)
- [ ] Influence scoring (PageRank-style)
- [ ] Composite trust score algorithm

**Expected Outcome**:
- Rank (0-100 normalized)
- Followers count
- Network distance (hops)
- Influence score
- Reliability score
- Recency score

**Effort**: 2 weeks | **Risk**: Medium | **Impact**: High

---

## Priority 3: Provider Management UI (Weeks 5-6)

### Recommendation: User-Facing Trust Provider Selection

**Why**: Empowers users to choose which trust providers they trust

**What to Build**:
- [ ] TrustProviderSelector component
- [ ] TrustMetricsDisplay component
- [ ] Provider trust level configuration (1-5)
- [ ] Encryption preference toggle

**Expected Outcome**:
- Users can select/deselect trust providers
- Visual trust metric breakdown
- Encrypted provider declarations
- Settings persistence

**Effort**: 2 weeks | **Risk**: Low | **Impact**: Medium

---

## Priority 4: Graph-Based Trust (Optional, Weeks 7-8)

### Recommendation: Optional Neo4j Integration for GrapeRank

**Why**: Enables Brainstorm-style personalized WoT calculations

**What to Build**:
- [ ] Neo4j integration layer (optional)
- [ ] GrapeRank algorithm implementation
- [ ] Graph-based network analysis
- [ ] Feature flag for gradual rollout

**Expected Outcome**:
- Personalized GrapeRank scores
- Advanced network analysis
- Brainstorm-compatible metrics
- Optional for users

**Effort**: 2 weeks | **Risk**: High | **Impact**: Medium  
**Status**: OPTIONAL - Defer to Phase 2

---

## Security & Privacy Recommendations

### ✅ Maintain Zero-Knowledge Architecture

**Implementation**:
- Trust assertions published to Nostr (not stored centrally)
- User controls which providers to trust
- Encrypted metrics in kind 10040 content
- No nsec exposure in any assertion

### ✅ Preserve Privacy-First Principles

**Implementation**:
- Per-user trust models
- RLS policies on all trust tables
- Optional anonymization of metrics
- Encrypted provider declarations

### ⚠️ Security Hardening

**Recommendations**:
1. **Provider Verification**: Validate provider pubkey signatures (CEPS handles)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Limit assertion publishing frequency
3. **Relay Diversity**: Support multiple relay providers
4. **Metric Validation**: Sanitize and validate all metrics
