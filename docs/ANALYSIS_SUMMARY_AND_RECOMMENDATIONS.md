# Analysis Summary and Recommendations

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE - AWAITING APPROVAL  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive analysis has identified **three critical issues** in the codebase's user profile data handling:

1. **Architectural Flaw:** Displayable user profile data is hashed instead of encrypted
2. **Security Flaw:** Hash verification is not enforced in client-decryption.ts
3. **UX Problem:** Empty strings displayed when known values unavailable

These issues affect core authentication, profile display, and data security across the entire application.

---

## Key Findings

### Issue #1: Hashing vs Encryption (ARCHITECTURAL)

**Problem:** User profile fields (username, bio, display_name, picture, nip05, lightning_address) are stored as one-way hashes, making them impossible to display to users.

**Current Workaround:** Plaintext values stored in session memory as "known values" - defeats the purpose of hashing.

**Affected Components:**
- Database: `user_identities` table (7 hashed columns)
- Backend: `register-identity.ts`, `user-service.ts`
- Frontend: `client-decryption.ts`, `DecryptedUserContext.tsx`, `useClientDecryption.ts`
- Types: `user-identities-auth.ts`

**Impact:** Core data architecture is fundamentally broken for displayable data.

### Issue #2: Hash Verification Not Enforced (SECURITY)

**Problem:** In `client-decryption.ts` lines 140-149, hash verification is computed but ignored. Incorrect known values are accepted without error.

**Security Risk:** No protection against data tampering or corruption.

**Fix:** Throw error on verification failure instead of silently returning incorrect value.

**Can be applied immediately** without affecting other systems.

### Issue #3: Empty Strings Without Known Values (UX)

**Problem:** When no known value is provided, function returns empty strings, causing blank UI fields.

**Root Cause:** Symptom of Issue #1 (using hashing instead of encryption).

**Solution:** Implement proper encryption so data can be decrypted without session-stored known values.

## Recommended Actions

### IMMEDIATE (Can be done now)

**Action 1: Apply Security Fix to client-decryption.ts**
- **File:** `src/lib/client-decryption.ts` lines 140-149
- **Change:** Throw error on hash verification failure instead of returning incorrect value
- **Risk:** LOW - isolated change with clear error handling
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours
- **See:** `docs/IMMEDIATE_SECURITY_FIX.md`

### SHORT-TERM (Requires approval)

**Action 2: Implement Full Migration Plan**
- **Scope:** Convert hashing to encryption for all displayable profile fields
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days
- **Risk:** MEDIUM - affects core authentication and profile display
- **Phases:**
  1. Database schema migration (add encrypted columns)
  2. Data migration (convert existing hashed data)
  3. Backend code updates (register-identity.ts, user-service.ts)
  4. Frontend code updates (client-decryption.ts, components)
  5. Testing and verification
- **See:** `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN_HASHING_TO_ENCRYPTION.md`

## Architecture Recommendations

### Encryption vs Hashing Classification

**ENCRYPT (Reversible - for display):**
- username
- display_name
- bio
- picture
- nip05
- lightning_address

**HASH (One-way - for verification only):**
- password (PBKDF2/SHA-512) ✅ Already correct
- authentication tokens
- session identifiers

**SPECIAL CASE:**
- encrypted_nsec: Already encrypted with Noble V2 ✅
- Remove redundant `hashed_encrypted_nsec` column

### Encryption Standard

Use **Noble V2 (AES-256-GCM)** for all profile field encryption:
- Consistent with existing nsec encryption
- Provides authenticated encryption
- Browser-compatible (Web Crypto API)
- Maintains zero-knowledge architecture

### Key Derivation

Use **PBKDF2-SHA256** with per-user salt:
- 100,000 iterations (current standard)
- Unique salt per user (already available)
- Consistent with existing implementation

## Risk Assessment

### Issue #1 (Architectural Flaw)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Scope:** LARGE (affects core data architecture)
- **Complexity:** HIGH (requires database migration)
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days
- **Risk:** MEDIUM (well-understood problem, clear solution)

### Issue #2 (Security Flaw)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Scope:** SMALL (isolated to one function)
- **Complexity:** LOW (simple code change)
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours
- **Risk:** LOW (can be applied immediately)

### Issue #3 (UX Problem)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scope:** MEDIUM (affects UI display)
- **Complexity:** LOW (resolved by fixing Issue #1)
- **Timeline:** Resolved by Issue #1 migration
- **Risk:** LOW (dependent on Issue #1)

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this analysis and supporting documents
2. **Approve** recommended actions and timeline
3. **Apply** immediate security fix (Issue #2)
4. **Plan** full migration (Issue #1)
5. **Execute** migration in phases

## Questions for Stakeholders

1. Should we apply the immediate security fix now?
2. What's the timeline for the full migration?
3. Should we maintain backward compatibility with hashed data?
4. Do we need to notify users about the security improvement?
5. Should we implement gradual rollout or big-bang migration?
6. What's the acceptable downtime for this migration?
