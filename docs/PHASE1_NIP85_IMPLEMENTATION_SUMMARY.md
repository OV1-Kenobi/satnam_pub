## 🎯 Core Objectives

### Objective 1: Trust Provider Implementation ✅
- Satnam.pub acts as NIP-85 trusted service provider
- Publishes kind 30382 (user-level assertions) events
- Publishes kind 10040 (provider declaration) events
- All events published to wss://relay.satnam.pub

### Objective 2: User Privacy Controls ✅
- Users configure trust score exposure (public/contacts/whitelist/private)
- Per-metric visibility controls
- Encryption preferences (NIP-44)
- Default to PRIVATE (opt-in model)

### Objective 3: Public API ✅
- External Nostr clients can query public trust scores
- Rate limiting (100 requests/hour per IP)
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Relay hints in responses

### Objective 4: Security & Privacy ✅
- Zero-knowledge architecture (no nsec exposure)
- RLS policies enforce user isolation
- Audit logging for all queries
- Signature verification for all events
