# Multi-Method Verification with Progressive Trust Scoring
## Phase 1 Week 4 Strategic Modification

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Feature Flag**: `VITE_MULTI_METHOD_VERIFICATION_ENABLED`

---

## Overview

The multi-method verification system represents a strategic enhancement to the hybrid NIP-05 verification system. Instead of using a fallback chain (kind:0 → PKARR → DNS), the system now executes all three verification methods **in parallel** and calculates a **trust score** based on method agreement.

This approach provides:
- **Higher confidence** in identity verification through consensus
- **Reduced risk** of impersonation or DNS hijacking
- **Progressive trust** model aligned with decentralized identity principles
- **Backward compatibility** with existing fallback chain behavior

---

## Trust Scoring Model

### Trust Score Calculation

| Scenario | Trust Score | Trust Level | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| All 3 methods agree | 100 | **HIGH** | Strongest evidence: kind:0 (user-controlled) + PKARR (DHT) + DNS (traditional) all confirm identity |
| 2 methods agree | 75 | **MEDIUM** | Strong evidence: Two independent systems confirm identity |
| 1 method succeeds | 50 | **LOW** | Weak evidence: Only one system confirms identity |
| Methods disagree | 25 | **LOW** | Conflicting evidence: Methods return different results |
| All methods fail | 0 | **NONE** | No verification possible |

### Method Priority (for primary result selection)

When multiple methods succeed, the system prefers:
1. **kind:0** (Nostr metadata) - User-controlled, most authoritative
2. **PKARR** (BitTorrent DHT) - Decentralized, censorship-resistant
3. **DNS** (Traditional) - Widely compatible, centralized

---

## Architecture

### Parallel Execution Flow

```
User enters NIP-05 and password
  ↓
Validate NIP-05 format and domain
  ↓
Check cache (5 min TTL)
  ↓
If multi-method verification enabled:
  ├─ Execute kind:0 resolution (3s timeout) ─┐
  ├─ Execute PKARR resolution (3s timeout) ──┼─→ Promise.allSettled()
  └─ Execute DNS resolution (5s timeout) ────┘
  ↓
Collect all results
  ↓
Calculate trust score based on agreement
  ↓
Determine overall verification status
  ↓
Display trust level and method results
  ↓
If verification passed (or disabled):
  ├─ Authenticate with password
  ├─ Create session
  └─ Redirect to dashboard
```

### Method Agreement Detection

The system checks if all verified methods agree on the NIP-05 identifier:

```typescript
// Example: All methods agree
kind:0 → alice@satnam.pub ✓
PKARR → alice@satnam.pub ✓
DNS   → alice@satnam.pub ✓
Result: Trust Score = 100 (HIGH)

// Example: Methods disagree
kind:0 → alice@satnam.pub ✓
PKARR → bob@satnam.pub ✓
DNS   → alice@satnam.pub ✓
Result: Trust Score = 25 (LOW) - Conflict detected
```

## Implementation Details

### Configuration

```typescript
const verifier = new HybridNIP05Verifier({
  enableKind0Resolution: true,
  enablePkarrResolution: true,
  enableDnsResolution: true,
  kind0Timeout: 3000,      // 3 seconds
  pkarrTimeout: 3000,      // 3 seconds
  default_timeout_ms: 5000, // 5 seconds for DNS
  cache_duration_ms: 300000, // 5 minutes
  
  // Phase 1 Week 4: Multi-method verification
  enableMultiMethodVerification: true,
  requireMinimumTrustLevel: "none", // Options: "none", "low", "medium", "high"
});
```

### Result Structure

```typescript
interface HybridVerificationResult {
  verified: boolean;
  pubkey?: string;
  nip05?: string;
  verificationMethod: "kind:0" | "pkarr" | "dns" | "none";
  
  // Phase 1 Week 4: Multi-method fields
  multiMethodResults?: MethodVerificationResult[];
  trustScore?: number; // 0-100
  trustLevel?: "high" | "medium" | "low" | "none";
  methodAgreement?: {
    kind0?: boolean;
    pkarr?: boolean;
    dns?: boolean;
    agreementCount?: number;
  };
}
```

### Database Schema

Three new tables track multi-method verification:

1. **multi_method_verification_results** - Individual verification attempts
2. **trust_score_statistics** - Aggregated statistics by time period
3. **verification_failures** - Failed attempts (from Week 3)

---

## Feature Flag Control

### Enable Multi-Method Verification

```bash
# .env.local or Netlify environment variables
VITE_MULTI_METHOD_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=true
```

### Behavior

- **When enabled**: All three methods execute in parallel, trust score calculated
- **When disabled**: Original fallback chain behavior (kind:0 → PKARR → DNS)
- **Default**: Disabled (false) for backward compatibility

---

## UI Integration

### Trust Level Display

The VerificationStatusDisplay component shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Identity Verified                 │
│                                     │
│ Trust Level: HIGH (100/100)         │
│                                     │
│ Verification Methods:               │
│ ✓ kind:0 (Nostr)                   │
│ ✓ PKARR (DHT)                      │
│ ✓ DNS (Traditional)                │
│                                     │
│ All methods agree on identity      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Method Agreement Indicators

- ✓ Green checkmark: Method succeeded and agrees
- ✗ Red X: Method failed or disagrees
- ⊘ Gray circle: Method not executed

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Trust Score Statistics

Track distribution of trust scores over time:

```sql
SELECT 
  trust_level,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(trust_score) as avg_score
FROM multi_method_verification_results
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY trust_level
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Method Agreement Analysis

Identify when methods disagree:

```sql
SELECT 
  identifier_hash,
  COUNT(*) as disagreement_count,
  AVG(trust_score) as avg_score
FROM multi_method_verification_results
WHERE methods_agree = false
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY identifier_hash
ORDER BY disagreement_count DESC;
```

### Method Success Rates

Calculate success rate for each method:

```sql
SELECT 
  'kind:0' as method,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE kind0_verified) as successes,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE kind0_verified) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM multi_method_verification_results
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'pkarr', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE pkarr_verified), COUNT(*), ...
UNION ALL
SELECT 'dns', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE dns_verified), COUNT(*), ...;
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Disagreement Detection

When methods disagree, the system:
1. Logs the disagreement for investigation
2. Assigns low trust score (25)
3. Requires user confirmation before proceeding
4. Alerts administrators to potential attacks

### Attack Scenarios Mitigated

| Attack | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| DNS hijacking | PKARR and kind:0 still verify correctly |
| Relay compromise | DNS and PKARR still verify correctly |
| DHT poisoning | DNS and kind:0 still verify correctly |
| Coordinated attack | Requires compromising all three systems |

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times

- **kind:0 resolution**: ~500-1000ms (typical)
- **PKARR resolution**: ~800-1500ms (typical)
- **DNS resolution**: ~200-500ms (typical)
- **Total (parallel)**: ~1000-1500ms (max of all three)
- **Cache hit**: ~10ms

### Timeout Handling

- kind:0: 3 second timeout
- PKARR: 3 second timeout
- DNS: 5 second timeout
- Overall: Returns results from completed methods

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Fallback Chain Mode

When `enableMultiMethodVerification` is false:
- Uses original priority-based verification
- Stops at first successful method
- Returns single method result
- No trust score calculated

### Migration Path

1. Deploy with feature flag disabled (default)
2. Monitor multi-method results in database
3. Analyze trust score distribution
4. Enable for subset of users (A/B testing)
5. Gradually roll out to all users

---

## Troubleshooting

### High Disagreement Rate

**Symptom**: Methods frequently disagree

**Causes**:
- DNS records out of sync with kind:0/PKARR
- Relay connectivity issues
- DHT propagation delays

**Solution**:
- Check DNS records are current
- Verify relay connectivity
- Wait for DHT propagation (up to 1 hour)

### Low Trust Scores

**Symptom**: Most verifications get low trust scores

**Causes**:
- One or more methods consistently failing
- Network connectivity issues
- Timeout values too aggressive

**Solution**:
- Check method health via `/api/verification/health`
- Increase timeout values if needed
- Verify network connectivity

### Performance Degradation

**Symptom**: Verification takes longer than expected

**Causes**:
- Slow relay connectivity
- DHT network congestion
- DNS resolution delays

**Solution**:
- Monitor response times per method
- Consider increasing timeout values
- Check relay/DHT/DNS service status

---

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor trust score distribution** in production
2. **Analyze method disagreements** for security insights
3. **Optimize timeout values** based on real-world performance
4. **Implement alerting** for degraded services
5. **Gather user feedback** on trust level display
