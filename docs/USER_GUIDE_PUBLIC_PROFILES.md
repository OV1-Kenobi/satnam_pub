## Introduction

The Public Profile URL System enables you to share your Satnam.pub identity with others through shareable URLs while maintaining complete control over your privacy. This feature is built on **privacy-first principles** with zero-knowledge architecture.

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **4 Visibility Modes**: Control who can see your profile (public, contacts only, trusted contacts only, private)
- ‚úÖ **Shareable URLs**: Generate clean URLs like `https://www.satnam.pub/profile/yourname`
- ‚úÖ **QR Code Generation**: Create QR codes for easy sharing in person
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-First Analytics**: Track profile views without storing personal information
- ‚úÖ **Verification Badges**: Display trust levels based on verification methods
- ‚úÖ **Zero-Knowledge Security**: Your private keys never leave your device

### Privacy-First Principles

1. **No Personal Information Storage**: Analytics use hashed viewer identities (no IP addresses, no tracking cookies)
2. **User Sovereignty**: You control visibility, discoverability, and analytics settings
3. **Encrypted Contacts**: Contact relationships are stored using privacy-preserving hashes
4. **Opt-In Analytics**: Analytics are disabled by default and require explicit consent

### Analytics Privacy

When analytics are enabled, the following privacy protections apply:

1. **Hashed Viewer Identity**: Viewer identities are hashed using SHA-256 (first 50 chars only)
2. **No PII Storage**: No IP addresses, cookies, or personally identifiable information
3. **Aggregated Data Only**: View counts and timestamps, no individual tracking
4. **Referrer Domain Only**: Only the domain is stored (e.g., "twitter.com"), not full URLs
5. **Owner-Only Access**: Only you can view your analytics data

**Example Analytics Data:**
```json
{
  "total_views": 42,
  "recent_views": [
    {
      "viewed_at": "2025-10-24T12:34:56Z",
      "referrer": "twitter.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Verification Badges

Verification badges display your trust level based on completed verification methods.

### Verification Levels

#### üîµ **Unverified**
- **Requirements**: No verification methods completed
- **Badge**: None displayed
- **Trust Level**: Lowest

#### üü¢ **Basic**
- **Requirements**: Any single verification method completed
- **Badge**: Green checkmark
- **Trust Level**: Low
- **Examples**:
  - Physical MFA verified
  - SimpleProof verified
  - Kind:0 verified
  - PKARR verified
  - Iroh DHT verified

#### üü° **Verified**
- **Requirements**: Physical MFA OR (SimpleProof + Kind:0)
- **Badge**: Yellow shield
- **Trust Level**: Medium
- **Examples**:
  - Physical MFA verified (NFC Name Tag)
  - SimpleProof + Kind:0 verified

#### üü† **Trusted**
- **Requirements**: Physical MFA AND (SimpleProof OR Kind:0)
- **Badge**: Orange star
- **Trust Level**: Highest
- **Examples**:
  - Physical MFA + SimpleProof verified
  - Physical MFA + Kind:0 verified
  - Physical MFA + SimpleProof + Kind:0 verified

### How Verification Levels are Derived

Verification levels are **automatically calculated** based on your verification flags using the following logic:

```typescript
if (physical_mfa_verified && (simpleproof_verified || kind0_verified)) {
  return "trusted";
} else if (physical_mfa_verified || (simpleproof_verified && kind0_verified)) {
  return "verified";
} else if (any_verification_flag_is_true) {
  return "basic";
} else {
  return "unverified";
}
```

### Completing Verification Methods

1. **Physical MFA**: Complete NFC Name Tag setup in Identity Forge
2. **SimpleProof**: Complete timestamping verification (Phase 1 feature)
3. **Kind:0**: Publish Nostr Kind:0 metadata event via CEPS
4. **PKARR**: Complete PKARR DHT verification (Phase 1 Week 1 feature)
5. **Iroh DHT**: Complete Iroh DHT verification (future feature)
