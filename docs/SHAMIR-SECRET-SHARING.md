# Shamir Secret Sharing for Family Nostr Key Management

## Overview

Our Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) implementation solves Nostr's key rotation problem by ensuring that **no individual family member ever has access to the complete private key**. Instead, the family's Nostr private key is mathematically split into shares using cryptographically secure methods, and requires consensus from multiple guardians to reconstruct for signing operations.

## üîê Core Principles

### Zero Private Key Exposure

- **No individual access**: No single family member can access the complete private key
- **Threshold-based reconstruction**: Requires consensus from multiple guardians (e.g., 3 of 5)
- **Temporary reconstruction**: Keys are reconstructed only for specific signing operations, then immediately cleared from memory
- **Guardian consensus**: All family events require approval from multiple guardians before signing

### Flexible Family Configurations

| Family Size | Recommended Config | Description       | Use Case                        |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 2 adults    | **2-of-2**         | Both required     | Couples with backup/inheritance |
| 3 members   | **2-of-3**         | Any 2 of 3        | Small family with redundancy    |
| 4 members   | **3-of-4**         | Majority required | Balanced security/availability  |
| 5 members   | **3-of-5**         | Majority required | Medium family                   |
| 6-7 members | **4-of-7**         | Super-majority    | Large family council            |
| 7+ members  | **5-of-7**         | High security     | Very large families             |

      "contactInfo": { "email": "bob@example.com" }
    }
  ],
  "threshold": 2,
  "totalShares": 2,
  "privacyLevel": 3
}
```

```typescript
// 3-of-5 Configuration (Medium Family)
POST /api/family/initialize-sss
{
  "familyId": "nakamoto_family_2024",
  "familyName": "Nakamoto Family",
  "guardians": [
    { "id": "mom", "role": "parent", "trustLevel": 5 },
    { "id": "dad", "role": "parent", "trustLevel": 5 },

}
```

```typescript
// 5-of-7 Configuration (Large Family Council)
POST /api/family/initialize-sss
{
  "familyId": "large_family_council",
  "familyName": "Extended Family Council",
  "guardians": [
    { "id": "patriarch", "role": "parent", "trustLevel": 5 },
    { "id": "matriarch", "role": "parent", "trustLevel": 5 },
    { "id": "eldest_son", "role": "family_member", "trustLevel": 4 },

    { "id": "longtime_friend", "role": "recovery_contact", "trustLevel": 3 }
  ],
  "threshold": 5,
  "totalShares": 7
}
```

### Step 2: Create Family Events

```typescript
// Family Announcement requiring guardian consensus
POST /api/sss-federated/create-event
{
  "familyId": "nakamoto_family_2024",
  "eventType": "family_announcement",
  "content": "We're planning to move to a new city. This affects our family's financial arrangements and Nostr account management.",
  "requiredGuardianApprovals": 3, // Majority of 5 guardians
  "privacyLevel": 3
}
```

### Step 3: Guardian Approval Process

```typescript
// Guardian approves the event
POST /api/sss-federated/guardian-approval
{
  "eventId": "sss_event_abc123",
  "approved": true,
  "reason": "I agree this is an important family decision that affects our shared financial responsibilities"
}

// Get pending events for guardian
GET /api/sss-federated/pending/nakamoto_family_2024
```

### Step 4: Share Provision for Signing

```typescript
// Guardian provides their share for signing (when threshold is met)
POST /api/sss-federated/provide-share
{
  "eventId": "sss_event_abc123"
}
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Emergency Recovery

```typescript
// Lower threshold for emergency situations
POST /api/sss-federated/request-key-reconstruction
{
  "familyId": "nakamoto_family_2024",
  "reason": "emergency",
  "expiresInHours": 6 // Short window for security
}
```

Emergency configurations automatically use a lower threshold (typically threshold - 1, minimum 2) and involve pre-designated emergency guardians.

### Key Rotation

```typescript
// Automatic key rotation every 6 months
POST /api/sss-federated/request-key-reconstruction
{
  "familyId": "nakamoto_family_2024",
  "reason": "key_rotation",
  "expiresInHours": 48 // Longer window for coordination
}
```

The system can automatically initiate key rotation based on configured intervals, ensuring long-term security.

### Inheritance Procedures

```typescript
// Family member inheritance/recovery
POST /api/sss-federated/request-key-reconstruction
{
  "familyId": "nakamoto_family_2024",
  "reason": "inheritance",
  "expiresInHours": 72 // Extended window for family coordination
}
```

## üìä Configuration Recommendations

### Guardian Roles & Trust Levels

| Role                 | Trust Level | Typical Responsibilities                     |
| -------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Parent**           | 5 (Highest) | Primary decision makers, financial oversight |
| **Trusted Adult**    | 4           | Extended family, close family friends        |
| **Family Member**    | 3-4         | Adult children, siblings                     |
| **Recovery Contact** | 3           | Lawyers, advisors, emergency contacts        |

### Share Distribution Examples

#### 2-of-2 (Couples)

- **Alice**: Shares 1, 2
- **Bob**: Shares 1, 2 (duplicate for redundancy)
- **Requirement**: Both must agree and provide shares

#### 3-of-5 (Medium Family)

- **Mom**: Shares 1, 2
- **Dad**: Shares 3, 4
- **Teen**: Share 5
- **Grandparent**: Share 1 (backup)
- **Friend**: Share 2 (backup)
- **Requirement**: Any 3 guardians must agree and provide shares

#### 5-of-7 (Large Family Council)

- **Patriarch**: Shares 1, 2
- **Matriarch**: Shares 3, 4
- **Son**: Share 5
- **Daughter**: Share 6
- **Uncle**: Share 7
- **Lawyer**: Share 1 (backup)
- **Friend**: Share 2 (backup)
- **Requirement**: Any 5 guardians must agree and provide shares

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Security

- **Galois Field Mathematics**: Uses GF(256) for secure polynomial operations
- **Information-Theoretic Security**: Fewer than threshold shares reveal no information about the key
- **Perfect Secrecy**: Even with quantum computers, insufficient shares provide no key information

### Operational Security

- **Time-Limited Reconstruction**: Keys exist in memory only during signing operations
- **Device Isolation**: Different guardians use different devices
- **Activity Logging**: All guardian actions are logged for audit purposes
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired shares and requests are automatically purged

### Privacy Protection

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Guardians can verify their role without revealing shares
- **Encrypted Storage**: All shares are double-encrypted in the database
- **Anonymous Participation**: Guardian identities are encrypted in storage
- **Audit Trails**: Privacy-compliant logging of all guardian activities

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Guardian Unavailability

1. **Identify**: Determine which guardians are unavailable
2. **Count**: Verify remaining guardians meet threshold
3. **Emergency Config**: Use emergency threshold if enabled
4. **Proceed**: Continue with available guardians

### Suspected Compromise

1. **Immediate**: Stop all key reconstruction requests
2. **Audit**: Review guardian activity logs
3. **Rotate**: Force key rotation with new shares
4. **Notify**: Alert all family members of security event

### Guardian Recovery

1. **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor verification of guardian identity
2. **New Shares**: Generate new shares for recovered guardian
3. **Share Redistribution**: Update share distribution if needed
4. **Testing**: Verify new configuration works properly

## üìà Performance & Scalability

### Computational Overhead

- **Share Generation**: ~50ms for 32-byte private key
- **Share Verification**: ~10ms per share
- **Key Reconstruction**: ~100ms for threshold shares
- **Memory Usage**: ~1KB per share in memory

### Storage Requirements

- **Per Share**: ~500 bytes encrypted storage
- **Family Config**: ~2KB encrypted configuration
- **Activity Logs**: ~1KB per guardian action
- **Total for 7-guardian family**: ~10KB ongoing storage

### Network Considerations

- **Guardian Notifications**: Can use email, Nostr DMs, or push notifications
- **Share Provision**: Encrypted API calls only
- **Event Broadcasting**: Standard Nostr relay network
- **Backup Storage**: Optional fedimint integration for share redundancy

## üìö Technical Implementation

### Mathematical Foundation

Our SSS implementation uses polynomial interpolation in Galois Field GF(256):

```
f(x) = a‚ÇÄ + a‚ÇÅx + a‚ÇÇx¬≤ + ... + a_{t-1}x^{t-1} (mod p)

Where:
- a‚ÇÄ = secret (private key byte)
- a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ..., a_{t-1} = random coefficients
- t = threshold
- Shares are f(1), f(2), ..., f(n)
```

### Key Reconstruction

Using Lagrange interpolation to find f(0) = secret:

```
secret = Œ£(i=0 to t-1) y_i * Œ†(j=0 to t-1, j‚â†i) (x_j / (x_j - x_i))
```

This mathematical approach ensures that:

- Any `t` shares can reconstruct the secret
- Any `t-1` or fewer shares reveal no information
- The system is information-theoretically secure
