# Timing Attack Mitigations

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to prevent timing attacks in the Satnam Family Banking application.

## What are Timing Attacks?

Timing attacks are a type of side-channel attack where an attacker measures the time it takes to perform cryptographic operations to gain information about the secret data being processed. In password/hash comparison contexts, different execution times can leak information about:

- The position of the first differing character
- The length of the stored password/hash
- Whether a username exists in the system

## Implemented Mitigations

### 1. Constant-Time String Comparison

**Location**: `utils/crypto.ts`

```typescript
export function constantTimeEquals(a: string, b: string): boolean {
  if (a.length !== b.length) {
    return false;
  }

  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    result |= a.charCodeAt(i) ^ b.charCodeAt(i);
  }

  return result === 0;
}
```

**How it works**:

- Always compares the full length of both strings
- Uses bitwise XOR to detect differences without early termination
- Accumulates differences in a single variable
- Returns false only after processing all characters

### 2. Authentication Security Improvements

#### OTP Verification (services/auth.ts:363)

**Before**: `if (sha256(otp_code) !== otpRecord.otp_hash)`
**After**: `if (!constantTimeEquals(sha256(otp_code), otpRecord.otp_hash))`

#### Challenge Verification (services/auth.ts:213)

**Before**: `expected.rows[0].challenge !== signed_event.content`
**After**: `!constantTimeEquals(expected.rows[0].challenge, signed_event.content)`

#### Public Key Verification (services/auth.ts:229)

**Before**: `expected.rows[0].npub !== npub`
**After**: `!constantTimeEquals(expected.rows[0].npub, npub)`

#### Privacy Manager Auth Hash (lib/crypto/privacy-manager.ts:24)

**Before**: `return hash.toString("hex") === originalHash;`
**After**: `return constantTimeEquals(hash.toString("hex"), originalHash);`

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Prevents Information Leakage**

- Attackers cannot determine the position of incorrect characters
- Execution time remains constant regardless of where differences occur

### 2. **Protects Against Username Enumeration**

- User existence checks take the same time whether user exists or not
- Hash comparisons always take full comparison time

### 3. **Strengthens Authentication**

- OTP brute force attacks become much more difficult
- Challenge-response authentication is more secure

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are implemented in `utils/__tests__/constant-time-comparison.test.ts` covering:

- Identical strings (should return true)
- Different strings of same length (should return false)
- Different length strings (should return false)
- Edge cases (empty strings, unicode characters)
- Real-world hash formats (SHA-256, bcrypt-like)

## Best Practices

### 1. **Always Use Constant-Time Comparison For**:

- Password verification
- Hash comparison
- Token validation
- Session ID verification
- Any security-sensitive string comparison

### 2. **Import and Usage**:

```typescript
import { constantTimeEquals } from "../utils/crypto";

// Good
if (!constantTimeEquals(storedHash, computedHash)) {
  throw new Error("Authentication failed");
}

// Bad - vulnerable to timing attacks
if (storedHash !== computedHash) {
  throw new Error("Authentication failed");
}
```

### 3. **Additional Considerations**:

- Use proper key derivation functions (PBKDF2, scrypt, Argon2)
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper salt management

## Related Security Measures

### 1. **Rate Limiting**

- OTP attempts are limited (3 failures invalidate the OTP)
- Authentication attempts should be rate-limited

### 2. **Secure Random Generation**

- All tokens and challenges use cryptographically secure random generation
- Proper entropy sources are used

### 3. **Hash Function Selection**

- PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations for key derivation
- SHA-256 for general hashing needs
- Scrypt for service configuration encryption

## Compliance

These mitigations help ensure compliance with:

- OWASP Top 10 security recommendations
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Bitcoin/Lightning Network security best practices
- Privacy-first architecture requirements

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. **Regular Security Audits**

- Review timing attack mitigations quarterly
- Test constant-time implementation effectiveness
- Monitor for new timing attack vectors

### 2. **Performance Monitoring**

- Ensure constant-time operations don't significantly impact performance
- Monitor authentication response times
- Look for timing anomalies that might indicate attacks

### 3. **Updates and Patches**

- Keep cryptographic libraries up to date
- Monitor security advisories for timing attack vulnerabilities
- Update mitigations as new attack techniques emerge
