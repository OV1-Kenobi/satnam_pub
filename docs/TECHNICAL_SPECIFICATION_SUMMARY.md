# Technical Specification Summary

## Document Overview

This comprehensive technical specification addresses three major enhancement areas identified in the decentralized identity expert review:

1. **Decentralized Identity Verification System** (Part 1)
2. **Proof-of-Personhood and Unique Personhood** (Part 2)
3. **Infrastructure Decentralization** (Part 3)
4. **Progressive Trust System** (Part 4)

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State
- Satnam.pub has strong privacy-first architecture and key rotation support
- Identity verification relies on DNS-based NIP-05 (centralized)
- No proof-of-personhood or unique personhood mechanisms
- Centralized infrastructure (Supabase, Netlify)
- Basic trust system without time-based escalation

### Target State
- Decentralized identity verification (kind:0 → PKARR → DNS)
- Comprehensive PoP/UP system with FROST-based sharding
- Self-hosted deployment options
- Progressive trust with time-based escalation and feature gates

### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 29 weeks (7 months)
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-5): Decentralized Identity
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 6-12): PoP/UP System
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 13-22): Infrastructure
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 23-29): Progressive Trust

```bash
VITE_HYBRID_IDENTITY_ENABLED=false
VITE_PKARR_ENABLED=false
VITE_POP_SYSTEM_ENABLED=false
VITE_UP_SYSTEM_ENABLED=false
VITE_PROGRESSIVE_TRUST_ENABLED=false
VITE_DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_ENABLED=false

## Conclusion

This comprehensive technical specification provides a clear roadmap for implementing three major enhancements to Satnam.pub:

1. **Decentralized identity verification** reduces DNS/X.509 dependencies
2. **PoP/UP system** prevents Sybil attacks and verifies personhood
3. **Infrastructure decentralization** enables self-hosted deployments
4. **Progressive trust** provides time-based privilege escalation

The phased approach (29 weeks) allows for thorough testing, gradual rollout, and minimal disruption to existing users. All changes maintain backward compatibility and can be rolled back if needed.

Implementation should begin with Phase 1 (Decentralized Identity) to establish the foundation for subsequent phases.
