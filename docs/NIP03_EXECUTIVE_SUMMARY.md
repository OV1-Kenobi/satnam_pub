# NIP-03 Attestation Architecture - Executive Summary

**Status:** DESIGN PHASE - AWAITING APPROVAL  
**Created:** 2025-10-27  
**Prepared For:** User Review & Approval

---

## WHAT IS NIP-03?

**NIP-03** = OpenTimestamps Attestations for Nostr Events

- Creates cryptographic proofs that Nostr events existed at specific times
- Anchors events to Bitcoin blockchain via OpenTimestamps protocol
- Enables immutable, verifiable timestamps without trusting relays
- Published as Kind:1040 Nostr events

---

## CURRENT STATE

### ✅ What We Have
- SimpleProof system creates OpenTimestamps proofs (Migration 034)
- CEPS publishes Nostr events reliably
- NIP-41 key rotation implemented (Kind:1776, Kind:1777)
- Family Federation with Master Context roles
- PKARR and Iroh backup attestation methods

### ⚠️ What's Missing
- NIP-03 Kind:1040 events not published
- No database tracking of attestations
- No role change attestations
- 2 placeholder comments in code waiting for implementation

---

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

### Three Critical Event Flows

#### Flow 1: Identity Creation/Registration
```
User registers → Kind:0 event created → SimpleProof timestamp → 
NIP-03 Kind:1040 event published → Blockchain confirmation
```

#### Flow 2: NIP-41 Key Rotation
```
User rotates keys → Kind:1776/1777 events → SimpleProof timestamp → 
NIP-03 Kind:1040 event published → Blockchain confirmation
```

#### Flow 3: Guardian/Steward Role Changes
```
Role change occurs → Role change event → SimpleProof timestamp → 
NIP-03 Kind:1040 event published → Blockchain confirmation
```

## KEY BENEFITS

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Immutability** | Key rotation events permanently recorded on Bitcoin |
| **Verification** | Anyone can verify event timestamps independently |
| **Audit Trail** | Complete history of identity changes |
| **Security** | Cryptographic proof of event existence |
| **Decentralization** | No reliance on centralized timestamp authorities |

---

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Database Changes
- **New Table:** `nip03_attestations` (130 lines SQL)
- **Tracks:** Event ID, OTS proof, Bitcoin block/tx, user, timestamps
- **RLS Policies:** User isolation, service role access
- **Indexes:** 4 indexes for query performance

### Code Changes
- **New Service:** `nip03-attestation-service.ts` (200 lines)
- **Updated Files:** 8 files total
- **Total New Code:** ~1,000 lines
- **Total Tests:** 180+ tests (>85% coverage)

### No New Dependencies
- SimpleProof API already handles OpenTimestamps
- CEPS already handles event publishing
- nostr-tools already available
- Web Crypto API for hashing

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Key Rotation (Weeks 1-2, 40 hours)
- Create NIP-03 service
- Integrate with key rotation
- Comprehensive testing
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL (Security events)

### Phase 2: Identity Creation (Weeks 3-4, 35 hours)
- Extend attestation manager
- Update IdentityForge UI
- Update registration flow
- **Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (User onboarding)

### Phase 3: Role Changes (Weeks 5-6, 30 hours)
- Create role change attestation service
- Integrate with family federation
- Governance flow testing
- **Priority:** 🟢 MEDIUM (Family governance)

## TIMELINE & EFFORT

| Phase | Duration | Effort | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Weeks 1-2 | 40 hours | Ready |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 3-4 | 35 hours | Ready |
| Phase 3 | Weeks 5-6 | 30 hours | Ready |
| **Total** | **6 weeks** | **105 hours** | **Ready** |

## FEATURE FLAGS

```typescript
VITE_NIP03_ENABLED=true                    // Master flag
VITE_NIP03_KEY_ROTATION=true               // Phase 1
VITE_NIP03_IDENTITY_CREATION=true          // Phase 2
VITE_NIP03_ROLE_CHANGES=true               // Phase 3
VITE_NIP03_RELAY_URLS=wss://relay.satnam.pub,wss://nos.lol
```

**Default:** All disabled (safe rollback)

---

## RISK MITIGATION

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| SimpleProof delays | Async processing, graceful degradation |
| Relay failures | Retry logic, fallback relays |
| Database issues | Comprehensive validation, RLS policies |
| User confusion | Clear UI messaging, documentation |
| Performance impact | Non-blocking, async operations |

---
