# PKARR Attestations User Guide
**Satnam.pub - Decentralized Identity Verification**

## What are PKARR Attestations?

**PKARR** (Public Key Addressable Resource Records) is a decentralized DNS system built on the BitTorrent DHT (Distributed Hash Table). It allows you to publish and verify identity information without relying on centralized servers.

### Why PKARR Matters

‚úÖ **Decentralized:** No single point of failure or control  
‚úÖ **Privacy-First:** Your identity data is cryptographically secured  
‚úÖ **Censorship-Resistant:** Cannot be taken down by any authority  
‚úÖ **Self-Sovereign:** You control your own identity attestations  
‚úÖ **Interoperable:** Works across different platforms and services

- Success/failure status for each attempt
- Error messages (if any)

---

### Manual Republishing

**Why Republish?**
- PKARR records have a 24-hour TTL (Time To Live)
- Automatic republishing happens every 6 hours
- Manual republishing ensures your record stays fresh

**How to Republish:**

1. **Click "Republish Now" Button:**
   - Located in the PKARR Attestations section
   - Button shows "Republishing..." while processing

2. **Wait for Completion:**
   - Usually takes 2-5 seconds
   - Sequence number increments by 1
   - "Last Published" timestamp updates

3. **Verify Success:**
   - Check publish history table
   - Latest entry should show "Success: ‚úì"
   - If failed, error message explains why

**When to Republish Manually:**
- After changing your NIP-05 identifier
- After updating your profile information
- If automatic republishing failed
- Before important identity verification

---

## PKARR Record Contents

Your PKARR record contains the following DNS TXT records:

### _nostr Record
```
_nostr.your-pubkey-hash  TXT  "nostr=npub1..."
```
- **Purpose:** Links your public key to your PKARR record
- **TTL:** 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **Privacy:** Public key is already public information

### _nip05 Record
```
_nip05.your-pubkey-hash  TXT  "username@my.satnam.pub"
```
- **Purpose:** Links your NIP-05 identifier to your PKARR record
- **TTL:** 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **Privacy:** NIP-05 is public information (like an email address)

**Important:** Your PKARR record does NOT contain:
- ‚ùå Private keys (nsec)
- ‚ùå Passwords
- ‚ùå Personal information (real name, address, etc.)
- ‚ùå Contact lists
- ‚ùå Message history

---

## Troubleshooting

### PKARR Verification Fails

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Contact hasn't published a PKARR record:**
   - Ask them to enable PKARR attestations
   - They need to complete identity creation with PKARR enabled

2. **PKARR record expired:**
   - Records expire after 24 hours if not republished
   - Ask contact to republish their PKARR record

3. **Public key mismatch:**
   - Verify you have the correct public key for the contact
   - Check for typos in NIP-05 or public key

4. **DHT relay connectivity issues:**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try again in a few minutes
   - Contact support if issue persists

---

### "Rate Limit Exceeded" Error

**Cause:** You've made more than 60 verification requests in the past hour

**Solution:**
- Wait 1 hour before trying again
- Avoid bulk verification operations
- Contact administrator to adjust rate limits if needed

---

### PKARR Attestations Section Not Visible

**Cause:** PKARR feature is disabled

**Solution:**
- Contact your administrator to enable `VITE_PKARR_ENABLED=true`
- Check if you're using the latest version of Satnam.pub

---

### Automatic Republishing Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- "Last Published" timestamp is older than 24 hours
- "Next Republish" shows "Overdue"

**Solution:**
1. **Manual Republish:**
   - Click "Republish Now" button
   - Check publish history for errors

2. **Check Scheduled Function:**
   - Contact administrator to verify Netlify scheduled functions are enabled
   - Check function logs for errors

3. **Verify Environment:**
   - Ensure `VITE_PKARR_ENABLED=true`
   - Check Netlify dashboard for function status

---

## Privacy & Security

### What Information is Public?

**Public Information (in PKARR record):**
- ‚úÖ Nostr public key (npub)
- ‚úÖ NIP-05 identifier (username@domain)

**Private Information (NEVER in PKARR record):**
- ‚ùå Private key (nsec)
- ‚ùå Passwords
- ‚ùå Real name (unless you choose to share it)
- ‚ùå Contact lists
- ‚ùå Messages

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Satnam.pub maintains a **zero-knowledge architecture**:
- Your private key (nsec) is NEVER sent to servers
- PKARR records are signed client-side with Ed25519
- All sensitive data is encrypted with Noble V2 encryption
- Server cannot decrypt your private information

### Best Practices

1. **Verify Before Trusting:**
   - Always verify contacts before sharing sensitive information
   - Aim for "Verified" or "Trusted" level for important contacts

2. **Keep Records Fresh:**
   - Republish regularly (automatic republishing handles this)
   - Manual republish after profile changes

3. **Monitor Verification Status:**
   - Check verification badges regularly
   - Re-verify contacts if their status changes

4. **Report Suspicious Activity:**
   - If a contact's verification fails unexpectedly, investigate
   - Contact support if you suspect impersonation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need PKARR attestations?
**A:** No, PKARR is optional. However, it provides an additional layer of decentralized identity verification that enhances trust and security.

### Q: Can I disable PKARR attestations?
**A:** Yes, contact your administrator to set `VITE_PKARR_ENABLED=false`. Your existing PKARR records will remain on the DHT but won't be updated.

### Q: How long do PKARR records last?
**A:** PKARR records have a 24-hour TTL. Automatic republishing every 6 hours ensures they stay active.

### Q: Can I delete my PKARR record?
**A:** PKARR records on the DHT cannot be deleted, but they will expire after 24 hours if not republished. Stop republishing to let your record expire.

### Q: What happens if PKARR publishing fails during registration?
**A:** Registration still succeeds! PKARR publishing is non-blocking, so failures don't prevent account creation. You can republish manually later.

### Q: Can others see my PKARR record?
**A:** Yes, PKARR records are public (like DNS records). They only contain your public key and NIP-05 identifier, which are already public information.

### Q: How is PKARR different from NIP-05?
**A:** NIP-05 relies on centralized DNS servers. PKARR uses the decentralized BitTorrent DHT, making it censorship-resistant and more privacy-preserving.

### Q: What are the DHT relays?
**A:** DHT relays are servers that host PKARR records on the BitTorrent DHT. Satnam.pub uses:
- `https://pkarr.relay.pubky.tech`
- `https://pkarr.relay.synonym.to`
