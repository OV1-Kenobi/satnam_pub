## Issues Summary

### Issue #1: Hashing vs Encryption (ARCHITECTURAL)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Scope:** LARGE (affects core data architecture)
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days
- **Risk:** MEDIUM
- **Status:** Requires full migration plan
- **See:** CRITICAL_ANALYSIS_HASHING_VS_ENCRYPTION.md

### Issue #2: Hash Verification Not Enforced (SECURITY)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Scope:** SMALL (isolated to one function)
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours
- **Risk:** LOW
- **Status:** Can be applied immediately
- **See:** IMMEDIATE_SECURITY_FIX.md

### Issue #3: Empty Strings Without Known Values (UX)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Scope:** MEDIUM (affects UI display)
- **Timeline:** Resolved by Issue #1 migration
- **Risk:** LOW
- **Status:** Dependent on Issue #1
- **See:** CRITICAL_ANALYSIS_HASHING_VS_ENCRYPTION.md

## Affected Components

### Database
- `user_identities` table (7 hashed columns)
- `privacy_users` table (secondary impact)
- `family_members` table (secondary impact)

### Backend Functions
- `netlify/functions_active/register-identity.ts`
- `netlify/functions/register-identity.js`
- `netlify/functions/services/user-service.ts`
- `netlify/functions_active/unified-profiles.ts`

### Frontend Components
- `src/lib/client-decryption.ts` (PRIMARY)
- `src/contexts/DecryptedUserContext.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useClientDecryption.ts`
- `useUserDisplayData()` hook

### Type Definitions
- `src/lib/auth/user-identities-auth.ts`

---

## Recommended Actions

### IMMEDIATE (Can do now)
‚úÖ Apply security fix to `client-decryption.ts`
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours
- **Risk:** LOW
- **See:** IMMEDIATE_SECURITY_FIX.md

### SHORT-TERM (Requires approval)
‚è≥ Implement full migration plan
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days
- **Risk:** MEDIUM
- **See:** MIGRATION_PLAN_HASHING_TO_ENCRYPTION.md

## Key Findings

### Problem #1: Hashing for Displayable Data
- User profile fields stored as one-way hashes
- Cannot be reversed to display to users
- Current workaround: plaintext in session memory
- Defeats purpose of hashing

### Problem #2: Verification Not Enforced
- Hash verification computed but ignored
- Incorrect values silently accepted
- No protection against tampering
- Security vulnerability

### Problem #3: Empty UI Fields
- Returns empty strings when no known value
- Causes blank profile fields in UI
- Symptom of Problem #1

---

## Architecture Recommendations

### Encryption vs Hashing

**ENCRYPT (Reversible - for display):**
- username
- display_name
- bio
- picture
- nip05
- lightning_address

**HASH (One-way - for verification only):**
- password (PBKDF2/SHA-512) ‚úÖ
- authentication tokens
- session identifiers

**SPECIAL CASE:**
- encrypted_nsec: Already encrypted ‚úÖ
- Remove redundant `hashed_encrypted_nsec`

### Encryption Standard
- Use **Noble V2 (AES-256-GCM)**
- Consistent with existing nsec encryption
- Browser-compatible (Web Crypto API)
- Maintains zero-knowledge architecture
