# NIP-03 Attestation Architecture - Design Updates Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ SQL Syntax Errors Fixed

**File:** `database/migrations/041_nip03_attestations.sql` (CREATED)

**Errors Corrected:**

| Error | Line | Original | Fixed | Reason |
|-------|------|----------|-------|--------|
| Invalid CONSTANT keyword | 44 | `nip03_event_kind CONSTANT 1040` | `nip03_event_kind INTEGER DEFAULT 1040 CHECK (nip03_event_kind = 1040)` | CONSTANT is not valid SQL; use DEFAULT with CHECK constraint |
| Invalid array syntax | 62 | `'{"wss://relay.satnam.pub"}'` | `ARRAY['wss://relay.satnam.pub']` | PostgreSQL uses ARRAY[] syntax, not JSON braces |
| Incomplete regex pattern | 74 | `'^[a-f0-9]{64}$'` | `'^[a-fA-F0-9]{64}$'` | Bitcoin txids can be uppercase or mixed case |

**Migration File Features:**
- ✅ Complete table definition with corrected SQL
- ✅ Comprehensive indexes for query performance
- ✅ Row-level security (RLS) policies for privacy
- ✅ Helper functions for attestation management
- ✅ Schema extension for PKARR integration
- ✅ Migration validation checks

---

### 2. ✅ Failure Handling & Backward Compatibility Clarified

**Section Added:** 3.5 FAILURE HANDLING & BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- SimpleProof Timeout/Failure: Non-blocking, logged to Sentry, admin alerts, graceful degradation
- CEPS Publishing Failure: Fallback relays, 24-hour queue, user notifications, monitoring
- Database Constraint Violations: Pre-validation, unique checks, foreign key verification

**Backward Compatibility Strategy:**
- Retroactive Attestations: Phase-based approach (Phase 1→3), opt-in for historical events
- Migration Path: No automatic retroactive attestations, batch processing available
- Feature Flag Rollback: Disable flag, preserve data, UI fallback

**Retry Logic:**
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s
- Max 3 attempts per event
- Jitter added to prevent thundering herd

---

### 3. ✅ Backend Environment Configuration Specified

**Section Added:** 5. FEATURE FLAGS & ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

**Backend Environment Variables (Netlify Functions):**
```bash
NIP03_ENABLED=true
NIP03_KEY_ROTATION_ENABLED=true
NIP03_IDENTITY_CREATION_ENABLED=true
NIP03_ROLE_CHANGES_ENABLED=true
NIP03_PRIMARY_RELAY=wss://relay.satnam.pub
NIP03_FALLBACK_RELAYS=wss://nos.lol,wss://nostr.band
NIP03_RELAY_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
SIMPLEPROOF_API_URL=https://api.simpleproof.com
SIMPLEPROOF_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
SIMPLEPROOF_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

**Fallback Values:**
- Primary Relay: `wss://relay.satnam.pub`
- Fallback Relays: `wss://nos.lol,wss://nostr.band`
- Timeout: 5000ms
- Max Retries: 3

**Backend Service Discovery:**
- Function to check feature flag state: `isNip03Enabled(phase)`
- Function to get relay URLs: `getRelayUrls()`
- Separate from frontend VITE_ variables

---

### 4. ✅ Rollback Strategy & Blockchain Verification Documented

**Section Updated:** 7. MIGRATION PATH & ROLLBACK STRATEGY

**Rollback Procedure:**
- Immediate Actions (0-5 min): Disable flag, verify UI fallback, check Sentry
- Short-term Actions (5-30 min): Disable phase flags, review logs, notify users
- Data Cleanup: Preserve attestations, mark as failed, or delete if corrupted

**Blockchain Verification Process:**
1. SimpleProof API Status Check: Health check, success rate, response times
2. Bitcoin Confirmation Polling: Query blockchain, poll every 10 min, update fields
3. Relay Attestation Validation: Query relays, verify signatures, track persistence
4. Monitoring Dashboard: Track creation rate, confirmation time, relay availability

**Pre/Post-Migration Validation:**
- Pre-Migration: Verify data integrity, check RLS policies
- Post-Migration: Test RLS, validate indexes, check constraints, run E2E tests

---

### 5. ✅ Operational & Security Risks Expanded

**Section Expanded:** 8. RISK ASSESSMENT

**Operational Risks (NEW):**
- SimpleProof API downtime: Monitor every 5 min, alert on failures
- Relay unavailability: Multi-relay strategy, automatic failover
- Database migration rollback: Pre/post validation, data preservation
- Attestation bottleneck: Async queue, rate limiting (100/min)
- Blockchain delays: Expected behavior, user communication

**Operational Runbooks:**
- SimpleProof API Outage: Disable flag, notify users, manual verification
- Relay Failure: Automatic failover, monitor success rate
- Database Issues: Rollback, preserve data, investigate
- High Latency: Scale workers, increase queue, monitor metrics

**Security Risks (NEW):**
- Attestation tampering: Verify signatures, use CEPS, blockchain immutability
- Private key compromise: Service role signing, no nsec exposure, quarterly rotation
- RLS bypass: Comprehensive testing, audit trail, Supabase review
- Replay attacks: Unique event IDs, timestamp validation, nonce checking
- Data leakage: Encrypt metadata, audit logs, RLS enforcement

**Security Procedures:**
- Key Rotation: Quarterly, update CEPS, audit trail
- Incident Response: Disable creation, investigate, notify users
- Audit Trail: Log all operations, monitor anomalies
- Compliance: Regular audits, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning

**Support & Customer Communication (NEW):**
- FAQ documentation, in-app status, email notifications
- Retry button in UI, support templates, automated retry
- Educational content, timeline expectations, status page
- Relay health check, fallback publishing, escalation

**Customer Communication Templates:**
- Attestation Pending Email
- Attestation Failed Email
- Blockchain Confirmation Email

**Risk Monitoring & Alerting:**
- Metrics: Success rate (>95%), confirmation time (<60 min), relay availability (>99%)
- Alert Thresholds: Success <90%, confirmation >2h, relay <95%, API >5s, DB >500ms
