## Files Modified

### 1. src/lib/signers/amber-adapter.ts ✅
**Issues Fixed**: 3

#### Issue 1: Type Safety - Unsafe 'as any' Assertions
- **Problem**: Used `(CEPS as any)` to bypass TypeScript type checking
- **Fix**: Created `CEPSWithNip46` interface with proper method signatures
- **Impact**: Type-safe access to CEPS methods, prevents runtime errors

#### Issue 2: Unsafe Environment Variable Access
- **Problem**: Used `(process as any)?.env?.[key]` without type safety
- **Fix**: Replaced with `process.env as Record<string, string | undefined>`
- **Impact**: Proper type checking for environment variables

#### Issue 3: Critical Browser Redirect Bug
- **Problem**: `window.location.href = uri` navigates away, preventing await completion
- **Fix**: Changed to `window.open(uri, "_blank")` to preserve context
- **Impact**: NIP-46 pairing handshake can now complete successfully

### 2. src/lib/signers/ntag424-adapter.ts ✅
**Issues Fixed**: 2

#### Issue 1: Silent Error Swallowing
- **Problem**: Catch block returned "error" without logging exception
- **Fix**: Added `console.error("[NTAG424Adapter] getStatus error:", e)`
- **Impact**: Debugging information available for troubleshooting

#### Issue 2: Missing SessionId Validation
- **Problem**: `String(sessionId || "")` silently converted missing sessionId to empty string
- **Fix**: Added explicit validation: `if (!sessionId) throw new Error(...)`
- **Impact**: Prevents silent failures and programming errors

### 3. src/components/auth/NfcAuthOrchestrator.tsx ✅
**Issues Fixed**: 4

#### Issue 1: Stale Closure in Timeout Callback
- **Problem**: Timeout captured old `active` value, closing wrong request
- **Fix**: Introduced `activeRef` to capture current request ID
- **Impact**: Correct request handling in timeout scenarios

#### Issue 2: Unnecessary Effect Re-runs
- **Problem**: `active` in dependency array caused effect to re-run on every request
- **Fix**: Removed `active` from dependencies, use `activeRef` instead
- **Impact**: Reduced unnecessary event listener re-registration

#### Issue 3: Callback Closure Issues
- **Problem**: `onClose` and `onAuthSuccess` captured stale `active` value
- **Fix**: Updated callbacks to use `activeRef.current`
- **Impact**: Correct request handling in all callback scenarios

#### Issue 4: No Unmount Mechanism
- **Problem**: `mounted` flag never reset, preventing remounting
- **Fix**: Added `unmountNfcAuthOrchestrator()` function
- **Impact**: Proper cleanup for tests, HMR, and dynamic scenarios

### 4. netlify/functions_active/pkarr-publish.ts ✅
**Issues Fixed**: 5

#### Issue 1: Misleading Comment
- **Problem**: Comment claimed "Publishes to DHT" but only stores in database
- **Fix**: Updated to "Stores PKARR records in database (DHT publishing Phase 2)"
- **Impact**: Accurate documentation of current behavior

#### Issue 2: Missing Sequence Validation
- **Problem**: No type or range validation for sequence number
- **Fix**: Added validation: must be non-negative integer
- **Impact**: Prevents invalid data in database

#### Issue 3: Missing Timestamp Validation
- **Problem**: No range validation for timestamp
- **Fix**: Added validation: ±1 hour past, ±5 min future
- **Impact**: Prevents replay attacks and clock skew issues

#### Issue 4: Critical Security - No Server-Side Signature Verification
- **Problem**: Signatures marked "verified: false" with comment "done client-side"
- **Fix**: Implemented Ed25519 server-side verification before storage
- **Impact**: Prevents forged PKARR records

#### Issue 5: Incorrect Verified Flag
- **Problem**: `verified: false` after storing record
- **Fix**: Changed to `verified: true` after successful signature verification
- **Impact**: Accurate verification status in database
