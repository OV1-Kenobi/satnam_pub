- **Impact:** Immutable event attestation

### 6. **Nostr Operations** ‚úÖ

- NIP-59, NIP-04/44 as fallbacks
- **Impact:** Consistent cryptographic operations

### 7. **Physical MFA** ‚úÖ
- NFC Boltcard integration with NTAG424 DNA
- AES-256-GCM encrypted PIN storage
- Server-side SUN verification
- **Impact:** Hardware-backed MFA

### 8. **Netlify Functions (Partial)** ‚è≥
- SimpleProof functions hardened (2/50 = 4%)
- Security headers utility designed
- Input validation patterns established
- Rate limiting framework documented
- **Impact:** Foundation for remaining functions

---

## ‚è≥ WHAT REMAINS (1-2 Tasks)

### Task 1: Apply Security Hardening to 48 Netlify Functions
- **Status:** 4% complete (2 of 50 functions)
- **Scope:** 48 functions requiring security improvements
- **Effort:** 220 hours (4-6 weeks)
- **Priority:** üö® CRITICAL

**Breakdown:**
- 15 CRITICAL functions (authentication, payments, admin, key management)
- 32 HIGH-priority functions (messaging, identity, wallets, NFC)
- 28 MEDIUM-priority functions (profiles, trust scoring, federation)

**Required per Function:**
1. Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, CSP, etc.)
2. CORS origin validation with whitelist
3. Input validation and sanitization
4. Rate limiting (database-backed)
5. JWT validation with proper signature verification
6. Error handling without information disclosure
7. Sensitive data protection in logs

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM-PRIORITY SECURITY ISSUES (5 Issues)

These should be addressed after CRITICAL functions hardening:

1. **Mock SecureSessionManager** (4-6 hours)
   - Replace mock implementations with real ESM wrapper
   - Locations: api/individual/lightning/zap.js, api/rewards.js, etc.

2. **Incomplete CSRF Protection** (8-10 hours)
   - Complete token generation and validation
   - Add middleware integration

3. **Lightning Node Validation** (2-3 hours)
   - Strengthen production environment checks
   - Reject demo keys and URLs more comprehensively

4. **Sensitive Data in Logs** (6-8 hours)
   - Audit and redact nsec, salts, hashes, OTP codes, tokens
   - Add log redaction utility

5. **JWT Expiry Validation** (4-6 hours)
   - Standardize validation with buffer time
   - Apply consistently across all modules

**Total Effort:** 24-33 hours

## üìä VULNERABILITY METRICS

### Current State:
- üö® **15 CRITICAL** vulnerabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **32 HIGH** priority issues
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **28 MEDIUM** priority issues
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **12 LOW** priority issues (acceptable)

### Target State (After Completion):
- ‚úÖ **0 CRITICAL** vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ **0 HIGH** priority issues
- ‚úÖ **0 MEDIUM** priority issues
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **12 LOW** priority issues (acceptable)

## üìà SECURITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Functions with security headers | 2 (4%) | 50 (100%) | 48 |
| Functions with CORS validation | 5 (10%) | 50 (100%) | 45 |
| Functions with input validation | 8 (16%) | 50 (100%) | 42 |
| Functions with rate limiting | 22 (44%) | 50 (100%) | 28 |
| Average security score | 58% | 90%+ | 32% improvement |
