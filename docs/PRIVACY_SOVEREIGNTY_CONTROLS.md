# Privacy & Sovereignty Control Modals

## Overview

The Satnam.pub platform includes two critical modal components for user privacy and family sovereignty: the **Privacy Controls Modal** and the **Sovereign Family Banking Modal**. These components provide granular control over privacy settings and family treasury management while maintaining the platform's privacy-first architecture.

## Privacy Controls Modal

### Purpose

The Privacy Controls Modal allows users to configure their privacy levels and view real-time privacy metrics. It provides transparency into data handling while giving users control over their information exposure.

### Features

#### Privacy Level Configuration
- **Public** - Minimal privacy, maximum transparency
- **Standard** - Balanced privacy and functionality
- **Enhanced** - High privacy with selective sharing
- **Maximum** - Complete privacy, minimal data exposure

#### Real-Time Privacy Metrics
- **Data Exposure Score** - Visual indicator of current privacy level
- **Sharing Permissions** - What data is shared with family members
- **External Access** - Third-party service permissions
- **Audit Trail** - History of privacy setting changes

#### Privacy Controls
- **Family Visibility** - Control what family members can see
- **Transaction Privacy** - Configure transaction detail sharing
- **Location Privacy** - Control location-based features
- **Analytics Opt-out** - Disable privacy-preserving analytics

### Implementation

```typescript
interface PrivacySettings {
  level: 'public' | 'standard' | 'enhanced' | 'maximum';
  familyVisibility: {
    transactions: boolean;
    balances: boolean;
    activity: boolean;
  };
  externalSharing: {
    analytics: boolean;
    location: boolean;
    social: boolean;
  };
  auditLogging: boolean;
}
```

### Privacy Metrics Calculation

The modal calculates privacy metrics based on:
- **Data Minimization** - Amount of data collected
- **Sharing Scope** - Who has access to user data
- **Retention Period** - How long data is kept
- **Encryption Level** - Data protection measures

## Sovereign Family Banking Modal

### Purpose

The Sovereign Family Banking Modal provides comprehensive family treasury management with built-in privacy protection. It allows families to manage their collective Bitcoin holdings while maintaining individual sovereignty and privacy.

### Features

#### Family Treasury Management
- **Collective Balance** - View family's total Bitcoin holdings
- **Individual Allocations** - Track member-specific balances
- **Spending Limits** - Configure role-based spending restrictions
- **Approval Workflows** - Multi-level approval for large transactions

#### Privacy Protection
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Verify balances without revealing amounts
- **Selective Disclosure** - Share only necessary information
- **Encrypted Communications** - Secure family messaging
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics** - Insights without data exposure

#### Sovereignty Controls
- **Individual Custody** - Members maintain control of their keys
- **Family Coordination** - Collaborative decision-making tools
- **Emergency Procedures** - Guardian override capabilities
- **Recovery Mechanisms** - Backup and restoration procedures

### Implementation

```typescript
interface FamilyTreasury {
  familyId: string;
  totalBalance: number;
  memberAllocations: Record<string, number>;
  spendingLimits: {
    offspring: number;
    adult: number;
    steward: number;
  };
  approvalThresholds: {
    largeTransaction: number;
    familyPolicy: number;
    emergencyAction: number;
  };
}
```

### Sovereignty Features

## Integration with RBAC System

Both modals integrate seamlessly with the hierarchical RBAC system:

### Role-Based Access
- **Private Users** - Full privacy controls, no family features
- **Offspring** - Limited privacy settings, family oversight
- **Adults** - Standard privacy controls, family coordination
- **Stewards** - Advanced privacy management, family administration
- **Guardians** - Privacy enforcement, family protection

### Permission Inheritance
- **Privacy Settings** - Inherited from higher roles
- **Family Access** - Controlled by role hierarchy
- **Approval Requirements** - Based on role and transaction size
- **Emergency Actions** - Guardian override capabilities

## Privacy-First Architecture

3. **Encrypted Storage** - All data encrypted at rest and in transit
4. **User Control** - Users control their data and privacy settings
5. **Transparency** - Clear visibility into data handling

### Security Measures
- **End-to-End Encryption** - All communications encrypted
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Verify without revealing data
- **Differential Privacy** - Statistical privacy protection
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation** - Collaborative computation without data sharing

## User Experience
