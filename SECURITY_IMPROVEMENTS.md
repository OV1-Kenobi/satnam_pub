# Security Improvements for Secure Storage

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements made to the `SecureStorage` class to address transaction handling, race conditions, and atomic operations.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Missing Transaction/Rollback Support

**Problem**: Database operations weren't wrapped in proper transactions, leading to potential consistency issues if operations failed partway through.

**Solution**:

- Added transaction support with automatic rollback on errors
- Implemented both database-level and application-level transaction handling
- Added fallback mechanisms when database transactions aren't available

### 2. Race Conditions

**Problem**: Multiple concurrent password updates could interfere with each other, causing data corruption or inconsistent state.

**Solution**:

- Implemented optimistic locking using both `encrypted_nsec` and `updated_at` fields
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for conflict resolution
- Used row-level locking in database functions where possible

### 3. Memory Security

**Problem**: Sensitive data (decrypted keys, passwords) could remain in memory longer than necessary.

**Solution**:

- Added comprehensive memory clearing in all methods
- Ensured sensitive data is cleared even when errors occur (using `finally` blocks)
- Clear both intermediate and final encrypted data from memory

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced `storeEncryptedNsec`

- Added proper memory clearing for encrypted data
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added transaction support preparation

### 2. Improved `updatePasswordAndReencryptNsecAtomic`

- **Transaction Support**: Uses database transactions when available
- **Optimistic Locking**: Prevents race conditions with retry mechanism
- **Memory Security**: Clears all sensitive data in `finally` blocks
- **Atomic Operations**: Ensures either complete success or complete rollback

### 3. Enhanced `deleteStoredNsec`

- Added transaction support for atomic deletion
- Proper error handling with rollback capabilities
- Graceful fallback when transactions aren't available

### 4. Better `retrieveDecryptedNsec`

- Improved error handling for decrypt operations
- Added documentation about caller responsibility for memory clearing
- More robust error reporting

## Database Changes

### New SQL Functions

1. **Transaction Management**:

   - `begin_transaction()` - Start a transaction
   - `commit_transaction()` - Commit changes
   - `rollback_transaction()` - Rollback on error

2. **Atomic Operations**:

   - `store_encrypted_nsec_atomic()` - Atomically store encrypted keys
   - `delete_encrypted_nsec_atomic()` - Atomically delete encrypted keys
   - `update_password_and_reencrypt()` - Atomic password update (needs crypto implementation)

3. **Schema Improvements**:
   - Added `updated_at` column for optimistic locking
   - Auto-update trigger for `updated_at` field

## Usage Notes

### Transaction Handling

The system gracefully degrades when database transactions aren't available:

1. First tries database-level transactions
2. Falls back to optimistic locking with retry logic
3. Maintains data consistency in all scenarios

### Memory Management

All sensitive data is cleared from memory using:

```typescript
this.secureClearString(sensitiveData);
```

### Error Recovery

- All operations include proper error handling
- Automatic rollback on any failure
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when features aren't available

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Atomic Operations**: All database operations are atomic
2. **Memory Security**: Sensitive data cleared immediately after use
3. **Race Condition Protection**: Optimistic locking with retry logic
4. **Transaction Safety**: Proper rollback on any failure
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling without data leakage
6. **Logging**: Security-conscious logging (no sensitive data in logs)

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Database Migration**: Execute `database/migrations/add_transaction_support.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Application Update**: The updated `SecureStorage` class is backward compatible
3. **Testing**: Test all scenarios including failure cases and concurrent operations

## Future Considerations

1. **Crypto Functions in Database**: Consider implementing encrypt/decrypt functions in PostgreSQL for true atomic password updates
2. **Audit Logging**: Add audit trail for all key operations
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for password update operations
4. **Key Rotation**: Implement periodic key rotation mechanisms

## Testing Scenarios

Test the following scenarios to ensure proper operation:

1. Normal password update
2. Concurrent password updates by multiple clients
3. Network failures during password update
4. Database connection loss during operations
5. Invalid password scenarios
6. Memory usage patterns under load
